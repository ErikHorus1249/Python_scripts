00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:23,130
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:11,463
Human beings come in three kinds:

3
00:01:14,546 --> 00:01:16,713
the living,

4
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:21,963
the dead,

5
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:28,005
and those who go to sea.

6
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:32,380
Aristotle

7
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:53,588
COAST OF SYRIA - TARTUS

8
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,171
One happy fishing boat.

9
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:55,796
That's merchant vessel 14,
still at slow speed.

10
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:58,088
Sorry.

11
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:07,713
I'd rather listen to the blue water.

12
00:04:09,338 --> 00:04:10,755
Tired, Socks?

13
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:14,005
The name's Chanteraide, thanks.

14
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:51,880
Incoming transmission
on the swimmers' frequency.

15
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,296
Uniform.

16
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:55,255
Uniform. Bravo.

17
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,671
Ok, swimmers in position.

18
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,088
Stand by to dive.
Request confirmation of pickup.

19
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:00,671
- XO?
- Copy.

20
00:05:01,463 --> 00:05:03,088
Run a sit-rep first.

21
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:07,130
Merchant vessel close, bearing 1-6-0.
Christened 14.

22
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:08,755
- 1,000 m, matched.
- Confirmed.

23
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,421
- Fishing boat, 1-9-0.
- 100 m, opening.

24
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:12,921
- Matched.
- Surface all clear

25
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:13,921
What's that?

26
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:23,588
Shit!

27
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:26,171
Frigate! Bearing 1-5-0.

28
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:27,755
Just started moving.

29
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,796
Contact. Frigate, bearing 1-5-1.

30
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,380
Send it over.

31
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:34,213
Holding on frigate at 8,000 m, 3 knots,

32
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:35,588
course 3-5-0.

33
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,255
- Keep on it.
- Copy.

34
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,880
Socks, give us more. Classification?

35
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:43,880
It transmitted with Polinom sonar
so the vessel must be Udaloy class.

36
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:46,005
- Or modified Udaloy.
- So, Russian.

37
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,255
Wait, I have ears on its prop.

38
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:52,671
Dry cavitation.

39
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,546
Galloping horse.

40
00:05:57,713 --> 00:05:59,880
104 rpm. Counting blades.

41
00:06:03,213 --> 00:06:04,755
Seven blades, so not Russian.

42
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:07,713
Iranian frigate.
<i>Zarathustra</i>, to be precise.

43
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,755
An Iranian vessel in Syrian waters?

44
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,838
<i>Zarathustra</i> is a heck of a toy.
Rapid, well-armed.

45
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,838
Torpedoes, rocket launchers, grenades.

46
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:16,796
And one hell of an active sonar.

47
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,255
High risk of detection.

48
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:21,630
Plotter!

49
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:23,546
When are we in its range?

50
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:26,463
Contact<i> Zarathustra</i>, bearing 1-5-4.

51
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,463
In one minute.

52
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,921
How long to swimmer pickup?

53
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:36,171
Four minutes.

54
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:40,630
Hairy picking them up
next to an Iranian frigate.

55
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,213
Could be fun.

56
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,171
Listen up!

57
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,130
Priority is avoiding counterdetection
by the frigate.

58
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:50,255
Assume Ultra-Quiet State.

59
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:52,005
Slippers on, not a sound.

60
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:54,838
Assume Ultra-Quiet State.

61
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:56,921
Swimmer pickup through torpedo tubes.

62
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,213
Copy that.

63
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:02,255
Delta, this is Control.
Clear tubes 3 and 4.

64
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,630
Flood the tubes
to recover swimmers, locking inboard.

65
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:07,171
<i>This is Delta, copy.</i>

66
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:08,713
XO, acoustics favourable.

67
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,838
We should slip through undetected.

68
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:14,505
Maybe ask Kiwi
to quit vacuuming Delta Section.

69
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,880
It's raising hell on sonar.

70
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:23,463
Delta, kill the vacuum.
It annoys our Golden Ear.

71
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,505
<i>Copy.</i>

72
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,796
Anything else?

73
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:28,338
Sure, the galley. As always.

74
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:33,630
Shit, guys, porn flicks for breakfast.

75
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:37,296
Mother Nature's remit.
At least, the hull's not vibrating.

76
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:39,255
Ask the CO to come to Control.

77
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:32,005
Captain, we're three minutes
from swimmer pickup.

78
00:08:32,338 --> 00:08:35,338
Iranian frigate detected.
No counterdetection but it's tight.

79
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,463
Tubes 3 and 4 rigged for them.

80
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,963
Suggest confirming pickup to swimmers.

81
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:42,213
- Very good. Confirm.
- Copy, sir.

82
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,171
Check this trace.

83
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:48,755
It gives nothing on audio.

84
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:50,546
Uniform.

85
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:52,421
Wait.

86
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:05,255
Sea bottom noise.

87
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,005
- VTWA!
- Video Trace Without Audio!

88
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,755
I repeat, VTWA!

89
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,838
- On the 5.
- Bearing 3-5-5.

90
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,630
Track it.

91
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,463
Maybe something in the trace.

92
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:29,796
Very weak, shifting.

93
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:35,421
Very slow rhythm.

94
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:37,796
Four beats.

95
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:41,338
4-blade prop, weird.

96
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:43,838
- Just a cargo ship. We're good.
- No.

97
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:46,296
Slender trace, so it's running silent.

98
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,088
Gotta be a sub.

99
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,296
- There are no 4-blade subs.
- I know.

100
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:55,130
Hold on, transient sound, same trace.

101
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:56,713
Decide, this isn't the UN.

102
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,088
Hear it?

103
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:01,130
Got the transient
but for me it's biological.

104
00:10:01,755 --> 00:10:03,546
- Sperm whale?
- A sick one.

105
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:07,588
I don't want poetry.
Whale or not? Sub or not?

106
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:09,296
The pickup is a go or not?

107
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:10,963
- Analysing.
- Move it!

108
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:13,088
- Quit fussing.
- Sonar.

109
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:16,088
Well-run, a sub is quieter than the sea.

110
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:18,421
The swimmers!

111
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,505
Romeo.

112
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,755
Receiving code urgent.

113
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:26,005
- They're in danger. Captain?
- Stand by.

114
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,421
I want Golden Ear's classification first.

115
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,005
Sir, blue procedure.

116
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,630
Break away and come back in six hours.

117
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:35,588
Classify it!
Something or nothing? Moving or not?

118
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:37,755
It's no game. Speed it up.

119
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,213
Come on, Socks!

120
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,505
Four blades, so not a sub.

121
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:45,880
But way too silent to be a cargo ship.

122
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:57,630
Concentrate, Chanteraide.

123
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:00,255
Go with your instinct.

124
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:02,046
For me, it's nothing.

125
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:03,838
Just another sperm whale.

126
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:06,213
- We're overthinking.
- Back off.

127
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:21,838
SIGNATURE UNKNOWN

128
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,005
I trust you.

129
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:50,921
Ok, it's not a submarine.

130
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,463
I declassify.

131
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,213
Good, no sub. Let's go!

132
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,213
- Chops, confirm pickup.
- Copy.

133
00:11:57,213 --> 00:11:59,338
Confirmed. Swimmers will be at pickup.

134
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:05,921
A sperm whale sub! Some golden ear!

135
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:07,713
In position, one minute!

136
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:10,463
Captain takes the boat.

137
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:42,713
Sonar, bearing of the ping?

138
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,171
Swimmers bearing 0-4-0. Come right.

139
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:47,338
Confirmed. On the ping.

140
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:49,213
Closing on datum Charlie 2.

141
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:53,171
- Go!
- Come right 15. Bearing 0-4-5.

142
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:56,255
- Come right 15. Bearing 0-4-5.
- Copy.

143
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:59,088
Helm, come right 15. Bearing 0-4-5.

144
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:00,671
Very good.

145
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,255
0-1-0.

146
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:12,713
0-2-0.

147
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,880
0-3-0.

148
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,130
Bearing 0-4-5.

149
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,546
- Very good.
- 1,300 m from swimmers.

150
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:22,005
In five seconds, engine astern 3.

151
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:38,005
- Go!
- Engine astern 3, reduce speed over 200m.

152
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:41,046
Engine astern 3 adjusted.

153
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:43,255
Speed 5 knots.

154
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,130
4.8 knots, 4.5...

155
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:20,130
Shit!

156
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,213
Your sick sperm whale?

157
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,463
Transient.

158
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:26,755
It's back and it's no cargo ship.

159
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:30,296
Possible sub, bearing 3-4-7.
Coming left, four blades.

160
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:32,130
- No sub has four blades.
- I know.

161
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,088
Poss-sub, bearing 3-4-7!

162
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:36,005
I want a solution in five seconds!

163
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:38,088
Five seconds for the solution.

164
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:39,671
Silence! Possible sub!

165
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:45,963
- Solution?
- Solution on poss-sub, at 2-2-0.

166
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:47,380
Speed 5 knots. 3,000 m.

167
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:50,463
Better solution.
5.5 knots for 2,900 m plotted.

168
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,505
Solution adopted.

169
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,546
Christened Sierra.

170
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,880
Sierra adopted.
Classify poss-sub, bearing 2-1-0.

171
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:57,630
2,900 m, 5.5 knots.

172
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,255
Getting a blade beat.
Glug-glug cavitation!

173
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,921
Poss-sub level 2 for Sierra.

174
00:15:02,046 --> 00:15:03,796
3-4-6 for Sierra.

175
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:05,171
Identify it!

176
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,338
No more fuckups.

177
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,380
It's deviated!

178
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:12,213
Level 3. Poss-sub 3 for Sierra.
Classified poss-sub 3!

179
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:15,463
Unidentified sub means Echo procedure.
Break away.

180
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:20,463
Swimmer pickup is our mission.
Speed it up!

181
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,171
Sonar, keep tight on Sierra.

182
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:27,463
- Torpedo, make ready a tube.
- Tube 1!

183
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,671
Sir, 70 rpm, could be Chinese.

184
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:33,171
4-blade Chinese? No.

185
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:36,546
I know it's a stretch
but maybe Russian Cougar.

186
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:39,088
- The Cougar isn't operational yet.
- Exactly.

187
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:40,921
I don't see what else.

188
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:42,588
Four blades, it's something new.

189
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:45,296
Sick sperm whale? Baby cougar?

190
00:15:45,463 --> 00:15:46,755
You're losing it!

191
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:48,880
We need you. Focus and identify.

192
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:50,171
Get to work!

193
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,213
Shit.

194
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:53,755
Baby cougar transmits encrypted.

195
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:58,921
Sir, I can't demodulate.

196
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:01,296
It's giving us to the Iranian.

197
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:15,838
- The wolf's call.
- The Iranian?

198
00:16:16,005 --> 00:16:19,088
- Their active sonar. It's detected us.
- XO...

199
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:22,588
- Close up action stations.
- Action stations!

200
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,380
Let's go, guys!

201
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,171
Control, action stations. Put it out!

202
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:27,921
<i>Action stations!</i>

203
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:32,338
Get that kit on!

204
00:16:35,338 --> 00:16:36,630
Engine ahead 5.

205
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,671
Control! Action stations closed up!

206
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:41,963
So, never let Socks classify
without triple-checking.

207
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,588
- What's that?
- A cuckoo!

208
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:02,421
Don't let me see a scrap of skin!

209
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,505
Gloves not good!

210
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:07,338
It'll pass right over us.

211
00:17:12,088 --> 00:17:14,546
Sir, with the chopper buzzing us,
break away.

212
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:16,380
Swimmers can't come in the tubes.

213
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:18,296
I can't hold station under a chopper.

214
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:19,713
Match in 700 m.

215
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,963
Adopted. In 700 m.

216
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,796
It's hopeless, we gotta go.

217
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:26,963
- Where's the RPG the swimmers left?
- The unilateral?

218
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,380
Go get it!

219
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:47,005
Wolf's call, bearing 3-5-5.

220
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,421
Sonar flooded. Fixing our position.

221
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:51,213
What depth to escape their sonar?

222
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,171
Three splashes on sonar!

223
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:28,796
Depth charges!

224
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,921
- Back from the screen!
- Shield your eyes!

225
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:40,880
Damage reports to Control!

226
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,088
Check all systems!

227
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,380
We've lost sonar.

228
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,421
Damage report? Do we have prop and helm?

229
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:11,713
We've got the helm.

230
00:19:12,671 --> 00:19:15,713
Alert systems active? Sonar in how long?

231
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,505
Alert systems active.

232
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:31,338
In less than one minute, he's back.

233
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,505
- Stand by to dive.
- No, surface!

234
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:37,088
- That's suicide.
- With a chopper sitting on us!

235
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:38,921
Sir, the RPG!

236
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,463
Get the automatic! Surface now!

237
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,796
- I'll go.
- No, me!

238
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:46,713
XO, take the boat!

239
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,546
We don't know the RPG works.

240
00:19:49,463 --> 00:19:51,130
XO takes the boat.

241
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:53,921
Engine ahead 6.
Take her up. It'll be bumpy.

242
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:55,880
Ahead 6, take her up.

243
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:57,546
Blow all ballast!

244
00:19:58,255 --> 00:19:59,505
Climbing.

245
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:03,505
Surface in 50 metres!

246
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:05,630
40 metres!

247
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:07,630
30 metres!

248
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,046
Chopper holding station.
Fixing our position.

249
00:20:11,296 --> 00:20:12,796
Christened Hotel 3.

250
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:06,338
I can't unlock it!

251
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:16,463
Fire!

252
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:29,338
- XO, swimmers closing.
- Engines to zero.

253
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:47,796
- Shoot here!
- Fire!

254
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:48,963
No!

255
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,005
<i>... worse hour by hour.</i>

256
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:46,505
<i>Finland calls for international support
against two Russian divisions</i>

257
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,130
<i>that invaded its southern tip
yesterday morning.</i>

258
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:51,796
<i>Europe's capitals are resigned</i>

259
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,713
<i>to total apathy from America.</i>

260
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,005
<i>The president of the Commission announced</i>

261
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,921
<i>that Russia's aggression
should not go "unanswered".</i>

262
00:23:59,088 --> 00:24:01,755
<i>So this evening, what does Russia want?</i>

263
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,338
<i>Are we at war?</i>

264
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:01,463
FOUR BLADES

265
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,630
<i>From the whole crew of the Titan.</i>

266
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:44,255
To France's best CO.

267
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:50,796
Thanks.

268
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:08,671
Sorry about that classification.

269
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:12,963
I'll find what it was.

270
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:18,713
Put it out of your mind.

271
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,171
We're small cogs in a big machine.

272
00:26:23,463 --> 00:26:24,838
Rest up now.

273
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,255
I can't even close my eyes.

274
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,713
Without hearing the wolf's call.

275
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,963
Damn sonar!

276
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:39,296
The wolf's call.

277
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:43,046
That'll be my soundtrack
when I check out.

278
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:46,838
For the <i>Titan</i>...

279
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,421
To the <i>Titan</i>!

280
00:27:22,713 --> 00:27:23,796
Come in.

281
00:27:31,796 --> 00:27:32,963
Morning, captain.

282
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:36,546
Captain, I request permission

283
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:38,213
to continue research ashore

284
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,713
and confirm my hypothesis
about that transient.

285
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:43,130
Your hypotheses are done, Chanteraide.

286
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:46,046
It's our job to take over analysis.

287
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:49,088
Russian Cougar? Blind alley.

288
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,963
It's no time to dump on the Russians.

289
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,630
It's a powder keg.

290
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,630
So what was the transient?

291
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:02,796
Most likely, a drone.

292
00:28:02,963 --> 00:28:06,296
I thought of that too.
But I heard an epicycloidal reducer.

293
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:08,963
Drones don't have reducers.

294
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,880
And there was life on board.

295
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:14,505
I heard it.

296
00:28:15,088 --> 00:28:16,005
Well, you...

297
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,713
You hear life. Great.

298
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,421
We calculate. Calculations work.

299
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,421
We identified the drone model.

300
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:26,005
The constructor.

301
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,130
The signature. It all checks out.

302
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:34,838
I've revoked your database access.

303
00:28:38,213 --> 00:28:41,296
I don't understand, sir.
I'm just asking to look.

304
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:45,713
- I promised captain Grandchamp...
- Bullshit promises.

305
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:50,380
Your flawed classification

306
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,338
nearly cost us a submarine.

307
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:57,088
Here at CIRA, we hang our heads in shame.

308
00:28:59,796 --> 00:29:01,546
Once and for all, Chanteraide,

309
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:03,130
this is the military.

310
00:29:03,296 --> 00:29:04,505
Not art school.

311
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,380
Morning, captain.

312
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:11,796
- What does he want?
- It's the chopper, I guess.

313
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:14,296
We're in shit, right?

314
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,088
Check flies.

315
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:18,755
All clear.

316
00:29:20,588 --> 00:29:22,630
You heard the President's speech?

317
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:30,338
Morning, admiral.

318
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:31,421
At ease.

319
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,921
One lemon, two lemons, three lemons.

320
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,338
Jackpot.

321
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,505
First lemon.

322
00:29:47,338 --> 00:29:49,046
You provoke a crisis in Syria.

323
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:51,255
Based on a flawed classification.

324
00:29:51,588 --> 00:29:52,463
Result...

325
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:56,046
A chopper downed in blue water.
Our sub barely makes it back.

326
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,463
Plus the chief of staff flips his lid.

327
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,338
A biggie.

328
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:05,421
Second lemon.

329
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:10,421
The President dispatches
ground forces to Finland.

330
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:15,296
The Russians threaten our ambassador
with an atomic warning.

331
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:19,421
First time ever,
all lines of communication down.

332
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:24,130
Third lemon.

333
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:28,921
Presidential orders
to reinforce our posture.

334
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,838
In other words,

335
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,463
one nuclear ballistic sub in the water.

336
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,130
Effective immediately.

337
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:38,630
So three lemons in a row. Jackpot?

338
00:30:41,755 --> 00:30:43,796
Gentlemen, cancel your turkey orders.

339
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:53,671
Fact is, you guys pulled off
an act of incredible bravery.

340
00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:56,796
When I commanded <i>Titan</i>,
I'd have done the same.

341
00:30:57,171 --> 00:30:58,005
So,

342
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,880
Grandchamp...

343
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:04,463
you are promoted
to a nuclear ballistic missile submarine.

344
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,505
The Navy's pride and joy is yours.

345
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,505
The <i>Formidable</i>.

346
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:12,546
Make immediate preparations.
A 10-week patrol, give or take.

347
00:31:13,296 --> 00:31:16,671
Admiral,
I promised my wife not to sail again.

348
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,088
Grandchamp,

349
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,671
we're at alert level 6.

350
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:26,171
Deterrence for now. No more, no less.

351
00:31:28,213 --> 00:31:30,796
But those submarines are my children.

352
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:33,755
Only the best will do for them.

353
00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:35,713
Whatever a president says.

354
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,880
Remember when I recruited you?

355
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:43,630
I said that one day I'd be thanking you.

356
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:53,421
At your command, admiral.

357
00:31:55,671 --> 00:31:56,588
D'Orsi,

358
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:58,838
you take command of <i>Titan</i>.

359
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:02,171
You have a problem with that?

360
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,755
- At your command, admiral.
- Very good.

361
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:09,255
You'll escort <i>Formidable</i>
until it goes stealth in blue water.

362
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,296
Then await instructions.

363
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:31,671
Conversation ended.

364
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,130
A 3RD FAILURE WILL RESULT IN ALERT.

365
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:49,880

366
00:33:50,546 --> 00:33:52,963
<i>we analyse and we interpret.</i>

367
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,213
We listen, we analyse and we interpret.

368

<i>After 60 days at sea?</i>

369
00:33:57,796 --> 00:34:00,255

370
00:34:01,171 --> 00:34:02,088

Change your password.

382
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:34,880

<i>Harmonic Spectra.</i>

387
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:01,713
- It's a classic.
- Never heard of it.

388
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,963
Not my field.
Ask my colleague who's in tomorrow.

389
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:06,880
It's urgent, actually.

390
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,505
- Virginie? Diane's in?
- Upstairs.

391
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:12,338
- I'll go see. Maybe she'll know.
- Thanks.

392
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:28,671
Was it you, looking for a book?

393
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,171
Diane, the bookshop owner.

394
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:39,505
But I can come back later.

395
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:41,255
No...

396
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:42,796
Sure, sorry, yes.

397
00:35:45,255 --> 00:35:47,005
The Maths book. That's me.

398
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,546
- <i>Harmonic Spectra</i>?
- Yes.

399
00:35:49,713 --> 00:35:51,796
The database says we have it.

400
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:53,921
But I can't find it right now.

401
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:59,005
Can you come back tomorrow morning?

402
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:02,755
At what time tonight?

403
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,255
Say,
when is my meeting with that publisher?

404
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:20,588
Sorry about the book.
In theory, I had it.

405
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:22,046
Turns out, not.

406
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:26,213
Why a book on spectral harmonies?

407
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:28,338
To analyse a sound.

408
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:30,630
You're a musician?

409
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,588
- I should've guessed.
- No, not a musician, an AWA.

410
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,796
Sorry...

411
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:39,838
Acoustic Warfare Analyst.

412
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:42,463
No kidding.

413
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:45,380
In real terms, what is acoustic warfare?

414
00:36:45,546 --> 00:36:46,796
Is it dangerous?

415
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,380
It's identification
of acoustic manifestations.

416
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:52,921
Sound signals.

417
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:54,755
Sounds.

418
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,255
You have perfect pitch?

419
00:36:57,505 --> 00:36:59,130
Yes, but it's irrelevant.

420
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:00,880
That's something else.

421
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:04,088
Alright.

422
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:10,963
Sorry.

423
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:16,046
It's intrusive. We don't know each other.

424
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:17,380
No problem.

425
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:21,338
- My actual first name is Prairie.
- Sorry?

426
00:37:21,921 --> 00:37:25,838
My parents thought
it was a typically French name.

427
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:29,088
In fact, it sounds weird.
So here I go by Diane.

428
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:30,338
Prairie?

429
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:35,630
Alright.

430
00:37:44,088 --> 00:37:45,505
Sorry, what did...

431
00:37:46,796 --> 00:37:47,796
I can't...

432
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,713
hear a thing.

433
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:03,088
<i>The military is redeploying defence forces</i>

434
00:38:03,255 --> 00:38:05,963
<i>with the mobilisation
of three infantry regiments.</i>

435
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,171
<i>Two squadrons of fighter pilots
are on constant alert.</i>

436
00:38:09,338 --> 00:38:12,963
<i>A nuclear ballistic missile submarine
will soon leave port.</i>

437
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:16,088
<i>Its departure from Brest is imminent</i>

438
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:18,005
<i>and its route is top secret.</i>

439
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:21,296
<i>Michael, can Europe
assure its own defence?</i>

440
00:38:21,463 --> 00:38:22,796
<i>That's the big question.</i>

441
00:38:22,963 --> 00:38:25,588
<i>Many wonder
if Finland is worth dying for.</i>

442
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:27,671
<i>The President has made a decision.</i>

443
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,338
<i>"It is not a question
of dying for Finland,</i>

444
00:38:31,463 --> 00:38:33,588
<i>"but saving the very idea of Europe,"</i>

445
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:36,671
<i>he declared a few hours ago
at the Brussels summit.</i>

446
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:56,588
So that's acoustic warfare.

447
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:48,921
I'm trying to get my head around
you living in there.

448
00:40:50,796 --> 00:40:53,046
Stroke of luck, meeting me.

449
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:59,213
Thank goodness
we couldn't find your Maths book.

450
00:41:01,463 --> 00:41:02,546
Hold on...

451
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:06,421
You knew all along you didn't have it?

452
00:41:06,838 --> 00:41:08,130
You planned it.

453
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:09,796
What?

454
00:41:09,963 --> 00:41:10,921
No.

455
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:13,546
It was in my database.

456
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,130
We never clear the database,
that's the problem.

457
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:25,463
You don't believe me?

458
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:29,546
We have a procedure
that deletes automatically.

459
00:41:31,046 --> 00:41:32,880
A procedure to delete what?

460
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:34,921
Books?

461
00:41:36,505 --> 00:41:38,005
Dismantled submarines.

462
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:41,380
They're deleted
from the operational database.

463
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:56,255
But not from the physical archives.

464
00:42:52,921 --> 00:42:54,546
EX-SOVIET BLOC

465
00:43:38,505 --> 00:43:39,671
That's it.

466
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:53,880
Paired double prop.

467
00:43:54,755 --> 00:43:57,171
That explains the four blades
and the transient.

468
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,171
<i>Timour III.</i>

469
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:03,130
The Soviet terror.

470
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:08,005
The hell they scrapped it.

471
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:17,796
You're out of your mind.

472
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:19,921
Captain...

473
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:21,880
Look!

474
00:44:22,713 --> 00:44:23,838
Your cellphone.

475
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,005
You are under arrest.

476
00:44:32,755 --> 00:44:33,880
Check that file.

477
00:44:34,796 --> 00:44:35,546
Captain!

478
00:44:38,713 --> 00:44:40,671
The transient is not a drone.

479
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:44,380
It's a Russian nuclear sub.<i> Timour III</i>.

480
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:46,671
Four blades, the same transient.

481
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:48,880
Identical acoustic signatures.

482
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:56,463
Including the asymmetry
due to shaft wear.

483
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:01,088
Decommissioned years ago, in theory.

484
00:45:01,255 --> 00:45:03,255
In fact stowed away by the Russians.

485
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:06,463
Until deletion from our database
by the procedure.

486
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:08,588
And years later, there it is.

487
00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:10,088
Untouched.

488
00:45:10,546 --> 00:45:12,255
Unclassified, incognito.

489
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:15,630
Captain!

490
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:26,880
Shit!

491
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,213
Your analysis checks out.

492
00:45:55,171 --> 00:45:59,088
The Brits faced the same rogue situation,
same transient.

493
00:45:59,213 --> 00:46:02,130
Cross-referencing data
leads us to the <i>Timour III</i>.

494
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,338
Which sheds a different light
on your conduct,

495
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:08,296
even if it remains
technically reprehensible.

496
00:46:10,588 --> 00:46:13,338
After discussions with the Admiral,

497
00:46:15,088 --> 00:46:16,713
this goes no further.

498
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:18,588
This time.

499
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,296
It rankles to tell you,

500
00:46:21,463 --> 00:46:24,421
but you may end up
on a nuclear ballistic missile sub.

501
00:46:25,505 --> 00:46:27,921
<i>Formidable</i>'s captain wants you aboard.

502
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:31,963
<i>Formidable</i>'s captain wants me?

503
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:34,838
I don't know him.

504
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:36,671
The new one, you do.

505
00:46:37,588 --> 00:46:38,671
Grandchamp.

506
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,713
He threw a hissy fit to get you.

507
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,588
Don't get over-excited.
There's a test first.

508
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:53,088
The Admiral has the last word.

509
00:46:53,796 --> 00:46:55,838
Get into uniform. Training starts today.

510
00:46:56,963 --> 00:46:57,921
Yes, sir.

511
00:47:24,713 --> 00:47:27,546
Russian sonar, low frequency. Type Shark.

512
00:47:27,671 --> 00:47:28,755
Vessel?

513
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,213
K-138.

514
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,671
New generation.

515
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:35,255
Plus five dolphins, two babies.

516
00:47:53,546 --> 00:47:54,380
Something there.

517
00:47:57,255 --> 00:47:58,296
Submarine.

518
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:00,880
Nuclear propulsion.

519
00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:02,130
Attack submarine.

520
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:04,296
Not American.

521
00:48:05,005 --> 00:48:06,046
Not British.

522
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:11,171
It could be the <i>Kiev.</i>

523
00:48:12,963 --> 00:48:15,338
No, there's an egg-whisk tone.

524
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:24,796
Nuclear ballistic missile submarine.

525
00:48:24,963 --> 00:48:26,130
SSBN.

526
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:28,505
Before going stealth.

527
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,880
If it had gone stealth,
you wouldn't hear it, Socks.

528
00:48:32,005 --> 00:48:34,338
Even the machine wouldn't detect it.

529
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:36,005
Anyway...

530
00:48:36,505 --> 00:48:37,713
FYI, it's...

531
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,880
<i>Formidable.</i>

532
00:48:39,588 --> 00:48:40,713
Really?

533
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,630
Not <i>Invincible</i>?

534
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,713
They're identical, constructed together.

535
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,963
Check spectral analysis.
<i>Formidable</i> first.

536
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,088
Then the other.

537
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:55,546
You see any difference?

538
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:41,796
Was <i>Formidable</i>'s turbine remachined
due to damage?

539
00:49:48,463 --> 00:49:49,755
The dream team.

540
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,296
- Ok, Socks?
- D'Orsi.

541
00:49:51,713 --> 00:49:53,213
Sorry, admiral, didn't see you.

542
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:55,005
Well...

543
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:59,088
Chanteraide, confirmed.
Boarding tomorrow, 4 am.

544
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,588
Well played, son.

545
00:50:02,588 --> 00:50:04,796
- You did your medical?
- All good.

546
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:06,630
Not on antidepressants?

547
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,171
Shows up in your urine.

548
00:50:09,338 --> 00:50:10,630
The SSBN

549
00:50:10,755 --> 00:50:12,171
isn't the Love Boat.

550
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:17,255
The mission is, ready to fire
in under an hour on presidential orders.

551
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:21,171
You're the country's life insurance.

552
00:50:23,046 --> 00:50:24,130
Copy that.

553
00:50:24,505 --> 00:50:27,380
3,000 years of civilisation
did not bring peace.

554
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:29,255
Only deterrence...

555
00:50:29,588 --> 00:50:31,713
Effective deterrence depends on

556
00:50:32,546 --> 00:50:33,880
sailors keeping quiet.

557
00:50:34,713 --> 00:50:37,005
"Diwel didrouz maro pa denn."

558
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:39,338
What's that?

559
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:40,838
The SSBN motto.

560
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:42,380
Your new home.

561
00:50:43,755 --> 00:50:46,421
"Invisible and silent, I bring death."

562
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:49,921
Good luck, son.

563
00:50:51,546 --> 00:50:52,838
Keep on the PIM.

564
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,880
Captain.

565
00:52:04,213 --> 00:52:05,463
<i>Titan</i>, red company.

566
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,963
Attention!

567
00:52:08,213 --> 00:52:09,338
Eyes front.

568
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:15,130
Company mustered and correct.
At your command, sir.

569
00:52:16,713 --> 00:52:17,921
Welcome aboard.

570
00:52:48,463 --> 00:52:50,588
<i>Formidable</i> blue company, attention!

571
00:52:59,505 --> 00:53:00,380

take over.

573
00:53:42,421 --> 00:53:43,671
XO, take over.

574
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:45,921
At ease.

575
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:47,921
Attention!

576
00:53:48,088 --> 00:53:50,880
Roll call. Respond present and board.

577
00:53:51,046 --> 00:53:52,213
- Abbad!
- Present.

578
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,505
- Aboulker!
- Present.

579
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:11,380
The doc found cannabis
in your urine sample.

580
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:19,046
He declared you unfit to serve.

581
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:26,838
I will not challenge it.

582
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,505
I must be able to rely on each man
operating at 100%.

583
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:52,588
Captain Grandchamp aboard!

584
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,296
Stop! Gates closing.

585
00:57:09,421 --> 00:57:10,796
Fortress procedure!

586
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:16,296
Loïc, give me a hand!

587
00:57:30,796 --> 00:57:32,005
Move!

588
00:57:32,963 --> 00:57:34,171
Coming through.

589
00:57:34,338 --> 00:57:36,963
- What's going on?
- Nuke R-30. Fired from Bering Sea.

590
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,505
The Russians are moving!

591
00:58:02,963 --> 00:58:04,338
Keep the info coming.

592
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,921
Faster!

593
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:08,505
President's office.

594
00:58:11,796 --> 00:58:14,546
The President is at Jupiter Command.

595
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:16,546
Upgrade to alert level 10.

596
00:58:17,213 --> 00:58:19,880
Tell Grandchamp to go stealth immediately.

597
00:58:22,505 --> 00:58:23,963
Keep the info coming!

598
00:58:24,921 --> 00:58:26,296
25 minutes left.

599
00:58:33,546 --> 00:58:34,796
FORTRESS PROCEDURE ACTIVATED

00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,005
Very good.

603
00:58:46,171 --> 00:58:47,796
What's that trace, north?

604
00:58:49,255 --> 00:58:50,421
Nothing. The 15.

605
00:58:50,921 --> 00:58:52,171
Identify contact 11.

606
00:58:52,338 --> 00:58:53,963
We have 11, bearing 2-3-9.

607
00:58:54,921 --> 00:58:56,171
Echo, Foxtrot.

00:58:58,005 --> 00:58:59,796
Echo, X-ray.

609
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:03,005
<i>Formidable</i> assuming stealth mode,

Salute<i> Formidable</i>'s formidability

Plotting priority on 12.

614
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:14,171
Mission accomplished.
No further instructions.

615
00:59:14,546 --> 00:59:16,546
If not on watch, stand down.

616
00:59:17,671 --> 00:59:18,880
Guys...

617
00:59:19,546 --> 00:59:21,838
Now or never for a workout or shower.

618
00:59:22,005 --> 00:59:23,088
Or even both.

619
00:59:23,588 --> 00:59:24,713
In the right order.

620
00:59:28,671 --> 00:59:30,880
<i>Formidable</i>, bearing 0-2-3. Losing her.

621
01:00:07,005 --> 01:00:09,713
NATO satellites confirm impact
on French territory.

622
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:12,713
- Paris spoke to the US?
- They say it's 100% Russian.

623
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:15,588
Coming from Russian waters
doesn't make it Russian.

624
01:00:15,755 --> 01:00:17,671
Russia signals it's not them.

625
01:00:17,796 --> 01:00:19,838
It's not like they'd admit it.

626
01:00:20,338 --> 01:00:23,838
Paris orders not to raise the alarm,
while impact can be avoided.

627
01:00:23,963 --> 01:00:26,463
By interception with a ballistic missile.

628
01:00:27,046 --> 01:00:28,671
They've tested that system?

629
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:31,338
- No.
- Clay-pigeon shooting.

630
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,671
I hate clay-pigeon shooting.

631
01:00:36,296 --> 01:00:40,088
Sir, our sub in the Bering Sea says
it recorded missile launch.

632
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,380
- Launch vessel had a four-blade prop.
- Four blades?

633
01:00:44,796 --> 01:00:46,880
<i>Timour III</i>. Put it on that machine.

634
01:00:47,005 --> 01:00:49,546
I want its signature.
Where's CIRA and his ears?

635
01:00:49,671 --> 01:00:50,588
Not inside here.

636
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,088
Fuck, we need him now!

637
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:53,838
We have no one to listen?

638
01:00:54,005 --> 01:00:54,963
Admiral...

639
01:00:56,671 --> 01:00:57,921
Socks, what the hell?

640
01:00:58,046 --> 01:00:59,713
Isn't it spliff time?

641
01:01:00,338 --> 01:01:01,880
Grab a seat and listen in.

642
01:01:04,046 --> 01:01:05,005
Better and better.

643
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,005
I'm sending sub and launch audio.

644

Well?

645
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:13,963
I have audio.

646
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:22,588
Yes, that's <i>Timour III</i>.

647
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:25,130
You're sure?

648

- Grandchamp's in stealth mode?
- Affirmative.

649
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:39,171
Transmit info to the Chief of Staff.
Russian launch confirmed.

650

Here we go.

651

01:04:57,546 --> 01:04:59,255

<i>R-30 missile destruction failed.</i>

01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:08,796
Mission failed.

700
01:06:11,005 --> 01:06:12,296
Estimated impact zone?

701
01:06:12,421 --> 01:06:14,421
Update the scenario. Let's go!

702
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,130
- Admiral, an anomaly.
- What?

703
01:06:17,505 --> 01:06:19,546
- There's a...
- Spit it out!

704
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:22,296
Missile first-stage separation is off.

705
01:06:22,463 --> 01:06:23,796
- The booster should...
- Chanteraide!

706
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:25,463
Too late.

707
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,713
Admiral, I...

708
01:06:27,213 --> 01:06:29,505
I've heard R-30 launches.
This is not one.

709
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,130
Not with a payload, at least.

710
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:33,380
Who let him in?

711
01:06:33,755 --> 01:06:34,838
Check the spectral.

712
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:36,171
Is he high?

713
01:06:36,338 --> 01:06:37,963
Please, just take a look.

714
01:06:38,088 --> 01:06:39,380
Cut the crap here!

715
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:41,921
Go and listen!

716
01:06:52,005 --> 01:06:52,921
Well?

717
01:06:53,046 --> 01:06:54,255
He's right.

718
01:06:55,171 --> 01:06:56,880
Weight-resistance ratio is off.

719
01:06:57,255 --> 01:06:59,963
- The issue's the weight.
- Too heavy or light?

720
01:07:00,088 --> 01:07:01,755
Too light. 20%.

721
01:07:02,796 --> 01:07:03,921
No nuclear warhead?

722
01:07:16,213 --> 01:07:18,380
Yes. That explains the ratio.

723
01:07:19,338 --> 01:07:21,546
Come on. You too, Socks.

724
01:07:44,838 --> 01:07:47,880
Get me the Chief of Staff
at Jupiter Command.

725
01:07:53,505 --> 01:07:55,296
<i>Admiral, can you hold?</i>

726
01:07:55,463 --> 01:07:57,713
No, get a message to him. It's urgent!

727
01:08:06,171 --> 01:08:08,630
Suspend communications.
Incoming and outgoing.

728
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:09,713
Yes, sir.

729
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,838
Control to Radio, comms suspended.

730
01:08:14,838 --> 01:08:15,880
Do not copy.

731
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:23,296
<i>This is the captain.</i>

732
01:08:24,713 --> 01:08:27,421
<i>A major attack is ongoing
on French territory.</i>

733
01:08:28,546 --> 01:08:30,088
<i>Our orders have changed.</i>

734
01:08:30,213 --> 01:08:33,421
The President has ordered me
to effect a counterstrike.

735
01:08:34,255 --> 01:08:37,838
<i>I authenticated the order
with the executive officer.</i>

736
01:08:38,838 --> 01:08:40,005
<i>XO, here.</i>

737
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:43,380
I confirm authentication
of the President's orders.

738
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:47,838
<i>Admiral?</i>

739
01:08:48,005 --> 01:08:51,338
General, a submarine
heard the R-30 launch in the Bering.

740
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:54,630
My analysts assert
nuclear payload is absent.

741
01:08:57,005 --> 01:08:58,921
I repeat. The missile is empty.

742
01:08:59,088 --> 01:09:01,296
<i>You vouch for your analysts?</i>

743
01:09:01,713 --> 01:09:02,588
Yes.

744
01:09:02,713 --> 01:09:03,796
<i>Three hypotheses...</i>

745
01:09:03,963 --> 01:09:06,380
<i>- General, Washington calling!
- I'll take it.</i>

746
01:09:06,546 --> 01:09:09,755
- General!
- <i>Sorry, admiral, the Secretary of State.</i>

747
01:09:11,088 --> 01:09:12,255
Shit!

748
01:09:12,671 --> 01:09:15,796
Why would the Russians
fire an empty missile?

749
01:09:15,921 --> 01:09:18,588
A counterstrike is inevitable.
It's absurd!

750
01:09:24,296 --> 01:09:25,963
- General?
<i>- Equation's changed.</i>

751
01:09:26,088 --> 01:09:27,671
<i>According to the Americans,</i>

752
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:30,880
<i>Two years ago, funds were wired
to an ex-Russian admiral,</i>

753
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:33,838
<i>formerly in command of the Pacific fleet.
120 million euros.</i>

754
01:09:34,005 --> 01:09:35,963
<i>The going rate for a submarine?</i>

755
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:38,963
For a scrapped <i>Timour III</i>, sure.

756
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:42,963
<i>Via various offshore accounts,
the money came from Al-Jadida.</i>

757
01:09:43,088 --> 01:09:44,838
<i>The US forgot to mention it.</i>

758
01:09:45,005 --> 01:09:48,088
- The<i> Timour III</i> is in jihadist hands?
<i>- Looks that way.</i>

759
01:09:48,213 --> 01:09:50,713
That's why there's no nuclear payload.

760
01:09:51,338 --> 01:09:53,005
And we have riposted.

761
01:09:54,921 --> 01:09:56,921
They're triggering nuclear war.

762
01:10:02,088 --> 01:10:03,005
Very smart.

763
01:10:03,171 --> 01:10:04,505
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

764
01:10:11,255 --> 01:10:12,755
The perfect trap.

765
01:10:14,088 --> 01:10:16,921
Down to the <i>Timour III</i>
buzzing you in Syria.

766
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,880
To be sure
we'd peg the launch on the Russians.

767
01:10:20,505 --> 01:10:22,630
It was all so we'd reclassify it?

768
01:10:27,588 --> 01:10:28,630
General?

769
01:10:28,796 --> 01:10:31,630
<i>I'm with the President. Cancel the strike.</i>

770
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,963
The Navy has procedures
that we respect unfortunately.

771
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:42,463
But there is no procedure
for recalling an SSBN strike.

772
01:10:43,255 --> 01:10:44,796
It's the principle of deterrence.

773
01:10:44,963 --> 01:10:47,755
<i>I know that.
Try to contact the submarine captain.</i>

774
01:10:48,755 --> 01:10:50,713
From reception of the strike order,

775
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,713
the sub's captain
must consider anyone who intervenes

776
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,171
as potentially working for the enemy.

777
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:59,921
Nobody can prevent Grandchamp
from launching that missile.

778
01:11:00,421 --> 01:11:01,755
Not me, not you.

779
01:11:02,546 --> 01:11:03,796
Not even the President.

780
01:11:05,713 --> 01:11:08,296
<i>Our only option
is to neutralise the captain.</i>

781
01:11:11,838 --> 01:11:13,921
General, I am under your command

782
01:11:14,088 --> 01:11:15,796
but I cannot do what I cannot do.

783
01:11:15,963 --> 01:11:17,921
<i>How long before Grandchamp launches?</i>

784
01:11:18,046 --> 01:11:19,505
Less than one hour.

785
01:11:19,796 --> 01:11:21,630
<i>It's that or apocalypse.</i>

786
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:26,963
From now on, our sole priority
is this strategic strike.

787
01:11:27,796 --> 01:11:31,088
<i>It's a turning-point in history.
We have all trained</i>

788
01:11:31,213 --> 01:11:32,880
for this situation.

789
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,380
The time has come

790
01:11:34,505 --> 01:11:36,630
<i>to do our duty. Your duty.</i>

791
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:39,171
<i>Formidable</i>, blue company,

792
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,046
I'm relying on you. Over and out.

793
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:49,005
I spent my life
teaching kids to respect the procedure.

794
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:52,380
To keep the country safe,
trust the system.

795
01:11:54,713 --> 01:11:56,296
Now I neutralise those kids?

796
01:11:56,421 --> 01:11:57,588
Action stations!

797
01:11:59,963 --> 01:12:01,880
You're head of our nuclear force.

798
01:12:03,338 --> 01:12:04,671
Grandchamp will listen.

799
01:12:04,796 --> 01:12:08,838
If we abandon procedure,
our deterrence will be discredited.

800
01:12:09,296 --> 01:12:11,046
Grandchamp cannot obey me.

801
01:12:11,171 --> 01:12:12,630
I could be manipulated.

802
01:12:12,755 --> 01:12:14,963
It's why there's the procedure.

803
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,338
Admiral, you say it year after year.

804
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:18,755
It's drilled into us.

805
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,671
"If it happens,
there'll be doubts and decoys.

806
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,421
"And men demanding we recall..."

807
01:12:24,546 --> 01:12:27,130
Hundreds of millions of lives
are at risk!

808
01:12:27,255 --> 01:12:28,546
- Don't crack!
- Cut it out!

809
01:12:29,421 --> 01:12:30,921
You think I don't know?

810
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,588
<i>Formidable</i>'s gone stealth.
We've no idea where.

811
01:12:33,755 --> 01:12:37,046
It just went stealth.
It can't be far from <i>Titan</i>.

812
01:12:37,171 --> 01:12:39,213
No sonar can detect it.

813
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:40,671
What do you suggest?

814
01:12:49,713 --> 01:12:50,671
It's now, admiral.

815
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:51,963
No, admiral.

816
01:13:27,963 --> 01:13:30,921
Couldn't you wear normal shoes
on a day like this?

817
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,130
Base was out of them?

818
01:13:39,255 --> 01:13:40,588
Going to the dogs.

819
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:44,255
Not surprising coming from you.

820
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,963
Didn't you spend three months
in a sub in your socks?

821
01:13:51,505 --> 01:13:53,630
You certainly earned your nickname.

822
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:56,963
Nice. What goes around comes around.

823
01:13:59,255 --> 01:14:00,880
<i>Admiral, this is CIRA.</i>

824
01:14:01,338 --> 01:14:03,380
<i>R-30 impact in the Compiègne forest.</i>

825
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,296
<i>No damage reported.</i>

826
01:14:05,463 --> 01:14:06,963
<i>No nuclear warhead.</i>

827
01:15:11,588 --> 01:15:14,255
Admiral, to what do I owe the honour?

828
01:15:14,796 --> 01:15:17,213
To all hands, this is Alfost!

829
01:15:17,755 --> 01:15:19,338
We fell into a trap.

830
01:15:19,713 --> 01:15:22,963
<i>Formidable</i> was ordered
to fire a nuclear missile at Russia.

831
01:15:23,463 --> 01:15:26,088
If the missile is launched,
the Russians counter.

832
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,755
I'll let you join the dots.

833
01:15:29,046 --> 01:15:32,755
What I'm about to say
is hard to take in, and harder to say.

834
01:15:33,546 --> 01:15:36,296
Our priority
is to stop Grandchamp launching.

835
01:15:37,213 --> 01:15:38,755
By all means necessary.

836
01:15:40,046 --> 01:15:42,171
This defies procedure, why trust you?

837
01:16:00,213 --> 01:16:01,713
Your Captain speaking.

838
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:05,088
Action stations!

839
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,171
In position.

840
01:16:09,296 --> 01:16:11,463
<i>Formidable</i>'s last known position?

841
01:16:12,005 --> 01:16:13,713
They went stealth in sector 7.

842
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:14,880
Sector 7?

843
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,630
In his shoes, where'd you go?

844
01:16:19,796 --> 01:16:21,338
Grandchamp is pure reason.

845
01:16:21,463 --> 01:16:23,255
He calculates for optimal outcomes.

846
01:16:23,421 --> 01:16:24,921
Optimal in this case?

847
01:16:25,088 --> 01:16:27,630
First up, whatever saves lives.

848
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:29,671
Saves lives? Meaning?

849
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:35,046
With nuclear missiles,

850
01:16:35,338 --> 01:16:38,796
to avoid collateral damage
you reset position at launch?

851
01:16:39,963 --> 01:16:41,713
It's not protocol but...

852
01:16:43,171 --> 01:16:46,880
To keep the hit clean,
it's best to fix position before launch.

853
01:16:47,796 --> 01:16:48,713
He'll do that.

854
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:49,880
For sure.

855
01:16:51,546 --> 01:16:53,130
But he can't surface.

856
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:56,588
He needs a magic point.

857
01:16:56,755 --> 01:16:58,546
Bring up nearby magic points.

858
01:16:58,713 --> 01:17:01,421
- Magic points?
- True, we don't have them.

859
01:17:01,755 --> 01:17:02,796
Only SSNBs do.

860
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:06,213
I commanded an SSNB. I need to remember.

861
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:07,463
Sector 7.

862
01:17:07,630 --> 01:17:09,380
Sector 8, two of them.

863
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:10,671
Mapped peaks.

864
01:17:10,796 --> 01:17:12,713
Calypso here and Circe here.

865
01:17:12,838 --> 01:17:14,005
ETA?

866
01:17:15,546 --> 01:17:17,296
Calypso, for him, ten minutes.

867
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,588
For us, 13.

868
01:17:19,755 --> 01:17:21,588
- Too late.
- Circe...

869
01:17:22,505 --> 01:17:24,338
We arrive pretty much simultaneously.

870
01:17:24,505 --> 01:17:26,130
We need him to go for Circe.

871
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:27,838
Circe.

872
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:31,880
- Chops...
- Admiral?

873
01:17:32,713 --> 01:17:35,546
Transmit to base
to send two aircraft over Calypso.

874
01:17:35,713 --> 01:17:38,921
They cover the sea
with sonobuoys and crank it up.

875
01:17:39,046 --> 01:17:40,880
See if the octopuses like AC/DC.

876
01:17:41,005 --> 01:17:41,921
Yes, sir.

877
01:17:42,213 --> 01:17:44,588
Transmitting code 5, confirmed Alfost.

878
01:17:49,755 --> 01:17:51,630
Grandchamp winds up in a moshpit

879
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,421
and has to swing over to Circe.

880
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:57,213
XO, take us to Circe.

881
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,421
Romeo.

882
01:17:58,713 --> 01:18:00,130
Plotter, bearing to Circe?

883
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:02,546
Alpha.

884
01:18:02,671 --> 01:18:04,005
2-3-2.

885
01:18:06,755 --> 01:18:09,171
CALYPSO MAGIC POINT
47°N 8°W

886
01:18:28,088 --> 01:18:28,921
Analysis?

887
01:18:29,088 --> 01:18:31,005
Sonobuoys. Type Dicasse.

888
01:18:31,171 --> 01:18:32,380
Lots of them.

889
01:18:32,546 --> 01:18:34,713
Dicasse, that's our Navy. What the hell!

890
01:18:35,255 --> 01:18:36,630
It's weird.

891
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:38,463
It's gotta be Alfost.

892
01:18:39,046 --> 01:18:40,255
Captain?

893
01:18:41,838 --> 01:18:43,963
Distance from Magic Point 2?

894
01:18:44,088 --> 01:18:45,838
Circe, 6,000 m at 2-8-4.

895
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,463
Captain takes the boat.

896
01:18:48,588 --> 01:18:50,588
Set course 2-8-4. Ahead 5.

897
01:18:51,005 --> 01:18:53,671
Captain, someone's messing with us.

898
01:18:53,796 --> 01:18:57,005
Maybe we should fire with less precision.
Time's short.

899
01:18:57,921 --> 01:18:59,796
No, we continue the sequence.

900
01:19:05,046 --> 01:19:07,171
- I'll be in position.
- Very good.

901
01:19:13,421 --> 01:19:15,796
<i>Missile room. Running checks.</i>

902
01:19:34,213 --> 01:19:35,880
Magic point 2,500 m.

903
01:19:40,338 --> 01:19:42,046
Why no insignia?

904
01:19:43,671 --> 01:19:45,880
Don't you want to die looking good?

905
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,713
What's this eyesore? You need comfort?

906
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,380
You're ballet dancers?

907
01:19:58,046 --> 01:20:00,630
If the computer's bust,
why isn't it replaced?

908
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,380
Because this is France.

909
01:20:05,088 --> 01:20:06,546
Only one works.

910
01:20:06,671 --> 01:20:08,880
Arriving at Circe. Let's reset now.

911
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:11,463
- Chops, take over.
- Yes, sir.

912
01:20:14,296 --> 01:20:15,796
Stand by to reset.

913
01:20:16,338 --> 01:20:17,588
Ready.

914
01:20:18,546 --> 01:20:19,880
Reset.

915
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,005
Reset complete.

916
01:20:32,171 --> 01:20:34,046
Position margin of error, 100 m.

917
01:20:34,213 --> 01:20:35,755
Optimal margin reached.

918
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,380
Attain launch depth.
When we're there, we fire the missile.

919
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:44,880
Waking missile.

920
01:20:47,213 --> 01:20:50,213
Magic point 1,000 m. Entering reset zone.

921
01:20:50,338 --> 01:20:52,380
At this distance,
try the underwater phone.

922
01:20:52,505 --> 01:20:53,713
Wait!

923
01:20:54,755 --> 01:20:58,421
Do that and it's simple.
They'll hear and locate us.

924
01:20:58,546 --> 01:21:01,296
Either they answer or they apply protocol

925
01:21:01,421 --> 01:21:03,046
and torpedo us.

926
01:21:03,171 --> 01:21:04,713
Stand by to engage.

927
01:21:06,005 --> 01:21:07,630
Heuristic, as methods go.

928
01:21:08,338 --> 01:21:09,463
Quit the philosophy.

929
01:21:10,505 --> 01:21:11,880
Yes, sir.

930
01:21:13,088 --> 01:21:14,421
But it's Grandchamp.

931
01:21:16,213 --> 01:21:18,755
- Torpedo, prepare to fire.
- Copy.

932
01:21:21,171 --> 01:21:23,088
Tubes one to four ready.

933
01:21:24,005 --> 01:21:25,505
Transmitting by TUUM.

934
01:21:25,671 --> 01:21:26,671
Copy that. TUUM.

935
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:29,380
As soon as you hear a sound,
give the alert.

936
01:21:29,505 --> 01:21:30,463
Copy.

937
01:21:46,213 --> 01:21:48,546
I have three frequencies, no bearing.

938
01:21:48,713 --> 01:21:50,546
- Check the lawn.
- Marked frequencies?

939
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:52,880
Yes. Possible submarine.

940
01:21:53,046 --> 01:21:54,296
Watch out, poss-sub!

941
01:21:58,005 --> 01:21:59,880
Control, get me the XO.

942
01:22:00,755 --> 01:22:03,796
XO, get back here to Control.
Poss-sub contact.

943
01:22:04,088 --> 01:22:05,421
<i>Copy that.</i>

944
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:07,713
Examine each trace.

945
01:22:16,255 --> 01:22:17,255
TUUM!

946
01:22:21,505 --> 01:22:23,213
The poss-sub. Plot it.

947
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:25,296
Bearing on TUUM? Cross-check.

948
01:22:25,463 --> 01:22:27,213
- 0-2-8.
- Bearing 0-2-8!

949
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:29,338
- 1,000 m.
- Torpedo standing by.

950
01:22:29,463 --> 01:22:31,588
Bravo Charlie 3.

951
01:22:32,005 --> 01:22:33,921
<i>This is Zulu Delta 4.</i>

952
01:22:34,046 --> 01:22:35,505
<i>Do you copy?</i>

953
01:22:35,671 --> 01:22:38,171
Zulu Delta 4, that's <i>Titan</i>. We take it.

954
01:22:38,338 --> 01:22:41,255
Captain, we have orders to launch.
There are rules.

955
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:43,963
- No TUUM.
- It's D'Orsi. My men!

956
01:22:46,005 --> 01:22:48,005
Why's he want us to transmit?

957
01:22:49,463 --> 01:22:51,755
- To detect us.
- D'Orsi wouldn't do that.

958
01:22:51,921 --> 01:22:54,005
Why did they surface earlier?

959
01:22:54,463 --> 01:22:55,963
Someone boarded. Who?

960
01:22:56,088 --> 01:22:57,755
This is Zulu Delta 4.

961
01:22:58,546 --> 01:22:59,338
Do you copy?

962
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:06,296
<i>Do you copy?</i>

963
01:23:08,671 --> 01:23:11,088
The President's order is irrevocable.

964
01:23:12,463 --> 01:23:14,046
<i>This is Zulu Delta 4.</i>

965
01:23:41,505 --> 01:23:42,796
Deactivate TUUM.

966
01:23:48,755 --> 01:23:50,380
Captain to crew!

967
01:23:50,921 --> 01:23:52,671
We continue launch procedure.

968
01:23:55,838 --> 01:23:57,630
200 m from launch depth.

969
01:24:08,963 --> 01:24:10,963
In any case, it's impossible.

970
01:24:13,171 --> 01:24:15,338
<i>Formidable</i>, stealth, Grandchamp.

971
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:18,380
Three lemons.

972
01:24:33,213 --> 01:24:35,505
Slightly stronger background noise.

973
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:38,380
No engine information.

974
01:24:39,546 --> 01:24:41,463
No information is information.

975
01:25:26,546 --> 01:25:27,588
It's him.

976
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:30,796
Bearing 2-3-9.

977
01:25:32,921 --> 01:25:35,796
- <i>Formidable</i> at 2-3-9.
- Maximum distance 1,200 m.

978
01:25:35,963 --> 01:25:38,630
At that distance, he heard our call.

979
01:25:39,296 --> 01:25:40,421
He's ready to launch.

980
01:25:41,338 --> 01:25:44,255
We have no choice but to engage first.

981
01:25:47,005 --> 01:25:48,213
Hold on, I...

982
01:25:49,505 --> 01:25:50,546
I've lost him.

983
01:25:50,713 --> 01:25:51,671
Shit!

984
01:26:00,005 --> 01:26:01,421
Find him, Chanteraide.

985
01:26:01,796 --> 01:26:03,671
Time's burning up. Let's go!

986
01:26:06,421 --> 01:26:07,755
Come on, Chanteraide.

987
01:26:08,213 --> 01:26:10,130
Death's only beauty is victory.

988
01:26:10,338 --> 01:26:11,713
We must engage.

989
01:26:12,713 --> 01:26:14,130
We must engage!

990
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,630
I'm trying.

991
01:26:18,921 --> 01:26:20,171
We must engage.

992
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:23,796
I can't do it.

993
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:26,338
Son, come back here.

994
01:26:27,796 --> 01:26:29,880
Get the other AWA. Stay focused.

995
01:26:30,046 --> 01:26:31,671
- They're our brothers.
- No!

996
01:26:31,796 --> 01:26:33,796
They're sailors with orders to launch.

997
01:26:33,963 --> 01:26:36,838
Come on, we have them.
They're right there.

998
01:26:39,338 --> 01:26:40,380
Come on.

999
01:26:44,005 --> 01:26:45,171
Control,

1000
01:26:45,296 --> 01:26:47,671
prep torpedo tube for underwater vehicle.

1001
01:26:48,171 --> 01:26:50,421
- What for?
- To talk to Grandchamp.

1002
01:26:50,963 --> 01:26:53,213
You knock in Morse, he lets you in?

1003
01:26:53,338 --> 01:26:55,213
Your options, besides firing?

1004
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:56,880
The pressure's too extreme.

1005
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:59,088
<i>Titan</i> submariners love pressure.

1006
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:00,963
Bullshit! This is real life!

1007
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:03,296
With that logic in Syria, we'd be dead.

1008
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:05,546
I know what I'm doing.

1009
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:08,921
Take care of <i>Titan</i>.

1010
01:27:09,505 --> 01:27:11,005
They're my children, too.

1011
01:27:18,755 --> 01:27:19,880
D'Orsi.

1012
01:27:22,588 --> 01:27:23,713
Good luck.

1013
01:27:30,921 --> 01:27:31,838
Track him.

1014
01:27:32,005 --> 01:27:33,338
Stay focused. Come on!

1015
01:27:35,338 --> 01:27:38,963
Delta section, prep vehicle.
No questions asked.

1016
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:42,338
Last chance.

1017
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:15,213
Very strange noise, bearing 0-1-5.

1018
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:17,213
Like a propeller with flippers.

1019
01:29:20,338 --> 01:29:21,588
A combat swimmer.

1020
01:29:21,921 --> 01:29:25,338
Clearly, <i>Titan </i>is hostile
and its manoeuvres are offensive.

1021
01:29:25,463 --> 01:29:26,755
We must engage.

1022
01:29:28,505 --> 01:29:29,505
Captain?

1023
01:29:40,296 --> 01:29:41,380
Torpedoes ready.

1024
01:29:42,463 --> 01:29:44,463
Standing by to engage, captain.

1025
01:29:48,046 --> 01:29:49,088
Engage <i>Titan</i>!

1026
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:38,421
Fire!

1027
01:30:38,713 --> 01:30:39,921
Delta section!

1028
01:30:41,255 --> 01:30:43,296
Fire in Delta section!

1029
01:30:45,005 --> 01:30:46,713
Masks on!

1030
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,630
Admiral, hull's intact.

1031
01:31:12,088 --> 01:31:14,588
We're watertight
but fire in Delta section.

1032
01:31:14,755 --> 01:31:16,505
Send more men to Delta.

1033
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:19,171
- We've lost <i>Formidable</i>.
- White noise.

1034
01:31:19,338 --> 01:31:20,671
Need a fixed position!

1035
01:31:23,005 --> 01:31:24,046
Where's D'Orsi?

1036
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:09,421
<i>Only your ears can save us.</i>

1037
01:32:29,463 --> 01:32:30,796
<i>I trust you.</i>

1038
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:39,338
Chanteraide! Breathe!

1039
01:33:01,713 --> 01:33:02,880
Inserting splice.

1040
01:33:03,046 --> 01:33:04,005
All clear?

1041
01:33:04,171 --> 01:33:05,171
Standing by.

1042
01:33:05,588 --> 01:33:06,713
Very good.

1043
01:33:18,463 --> 01:33:19,463
Weapons officer?

1044
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:21,088
When you're ready, sir.

1045
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,505
Control, this is XO.

1046
01:33:24,671 --> 01:33:26,630
Ready to enter President's code.

1047
01:33:26,796 --> 01:33:27,671
Copy that.

1048
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:29,296
Captain,

1049
01:33:29,421 --> 01:33:30,671
when you're ready.

1050
01:34:02,046 --> 01:34:04,338
<i>Countdown to enter President's code.</i>

1051
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:13,588
Ten... Nine...

1052
01:34:22,088 --> 01:34:23,796
Enter President's code.

1053
01:34:28,338 --> 01:34:29,505
Code confirmed.

1054
01:34:31,171 --> 01:34:32,546
Code confirmed.

1055
01:35:12,213 --> 01:35:13,046
Three minutes!

1056
01:35:13,213 --> 01:35:14,088
Let's go.

1057
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:20,588
Silence!

1058
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:30,588
Missile alignment underway.
Maintain course.

1059
01:35:31,088 --> 01:35:33,546
- I repeat, maintain course.
- Copy.

1060
01:35:33,671 --> 01:35:34,921
Helm is at 2-7-0.

1061
01:35:35,088 --> 01:35:36,296
Open missile door!

1062
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:37,588
Copy.

1063
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:02,880
Torpedo.

1064
01:36:06,296 --> 01:36:07,213
Torpedo alert!

1065
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:12,380
Fired by <i>Titan</i>. Captain, break away.

1066
01:36:13,046 --> 01:36:15,130
Negative. Alignment underway.

1067
01:36:16,213 --> 01:36:18,046
- How long to launch?
- 160 secs!

1068
01:36:18,713 --> 01:36:21,130
- How long to torpedo impact?
- 120 secs.

1069
01:36:21,296 --> 01:36:23,796
- Torpedo is wire-guided.
- We must break away.

1070
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:28,046
Let's make that wire snap. Torpedo!

1071
01:36:28,463 --> 01:36:29,880
Engage<i> Titan</i>!

1072
01:36:30,296 --> 01:36:32,130
Urgent launch, tube 2!

1073
01:36:32,255 --> 01:36:33,088
Bearing 0-5-9!

1074
01:36:33,213 --> 01:36:34,171
TORPEDO FIRED

1075
01:36:38,505 --> 01:36:41,671
Torpedo alert!
Headed straight for us, 900 m!

1076
01:36:45,796 --> 01:36:46,838
Quiet.

1077
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:48,255
Quiet!

1078
01:36:48,463 --> 01:36:49,380
We expected it.

1079
01:36:49,755 --> 01:36:52,255
- We must break away.
- It's what he wants.

1080
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:54,005
To snap the wire. I stay put.

1081
01:36:55,088 --> 01:36:56,380
Maintain course.

1082
01:36:57,213 --> 01:36:58,171
Go on, back off!

1083
01:36:58,296 --> 01:37:00,046
Snap your fucking wire!

1084
01:37:00,171 --> 01:37:02,421
Captain, <i>Titan</i> is not breaking away.

1085
01:37:02,963 --> 01:37:04,213
Torpedo, 700 m.

1086
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:06,088
- 700 m!
- Accelerating on audio.

1087
01:37:07,046 --> 01:37:08,921
Veer right. Dive!

1088
01:37:10,088 --> 01:37:10,963
Chops!

1089
01:37:11,421 --> 01:37:12,838
Veer right! Dive!

1090
01:37:13,671 --> 01:37:15,005
Chops, what the hell!

1091
01:37:16,505 --> 01:37:18,088
Break away. We're gonna die!

1092
01:37:18,213 --> 01:37:19,505
Don't let me down.

1093
01:37:21,546 --> 01:37:22,463
Cut it out!

1094
01:37:25,046 --> 01:37:26,963
We gotta break away!

1095
01:37:28,130 --> 01:37:30,088
- We're gonna die!
- Stay focused.

1096
01:37:32,463 --> 01:37:34,171
Focus on your screens!

1097
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:43,421
Captain, we're gonna catch it.

1098
01:37:44,338 --> 01:37:45,213
Masks on!

1099
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:50,671
<i>Hallowed be thy name</i>

1100
01:37:51,505 --> 01:37:52,296
Masks on!

1101
01:37:52,588 --> 01:37:55,296
<i>Your will be done
On Earth as it is in Heaven</i>

1102
01:37:55,755 --> 01:37:56,713
Men!

1103
01:37:58,088 --> 01:37:59,671
It was an honour to sail with you.

1104
01:38:01,505 --> 01:38:02,880
We'll see this through!

1105
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,005
I'll take guidance on manual.

1106
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:08,213
Bring up torpedo telemetry.

1107
01:38:08,755 --> 01:38:10,713
Torpedo headed straight for target.

1108
01:38:10,838 --> 01:38:12,338
Time to missile launch?

1109
01:38:12,505 --> 01:38:13,421
40 seconds.

1110
01:38:14,088 --> 01:38:15,546
Buy ten more.

1111
01:38:16,088 --> 01:38:16,963
Deploy decoy!

1112
01:38:24,130 --> 01:38:24,838
FORMIDABLE

1113
01:38:24,963 --> 01:38:26,338
Solution uncertain. Target moving.

1114
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,838
- No, that's a decoy.
- Sure, sir?

1115
01:38:28,963 --> 01:38:31,088
- Machine says no decoy.
- Come left.

1116
01:38:31,213 --> 01:38:34,255
- I know. <i>Formidable</i>'s my baby.
- Coming left.

1117
01:38:37,588 --> 01:38:39,963
Captain, torpedo headed straight for us.

1118
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:42,338
Cut engines and sonar. We play dead.

1119
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,255
- It's gone!
- Watch. It'll reappear there.

1120
01:38:50,921 --> 01:38:52,088
Hold on.

1121
01:38:53,171 --> 01:38:53,880
Missile!

1122
01:38:54,005 --> 01:38:55,630
Launch authorised in 20 secs!

1123

Torpedo impact, 15 secs.

1124
01:38:58,421 --> 01:38:59,421
It's over, sir.

1125
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:03,213
FORMIDABLE

1126
01:39:03,338 --> 01:39:06,505
- Adopted!
- On target, solution positive.

1127
01:39:07,046 --> 01:39:08,255
Target reached, 10 secs!

1128
01:39:10,463 --> 01:39:12,796
Blow air tanks. Create double target!

1129
01:39:17,046 --> 01:39:18,755
Captain, launch authorised!

1130
01:40:19,755 --> 01:40:21,046
Survivors?

1131
01:40:21,963 --> 01:40:23,005
Anyone?

1132
01:40:24,463 --> 01:40:25,505
Anyone answer me?

1133
01:40:37,088 --> 01:40:38,005
Socks!

1134
01:40:38,546 --> 01:40:39,796
C'mon, Socks!

1135
01:40:57,796 --> 01:41:00,088

Negative, Chops.

1142
01:41:22,296 --> 01:41:24,005
First, we launch the missile.

1143
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:28,421
No air in circuit!

1144
01:41:28,588 --> 01:41:29,671
Masks off!

01:41:29,838 --> 01:41:30,963
Monoxide.

Air's contaminated, sir!

1147
01:41:33,338 --> 01:41:34,755
Evacuate control room.

1148
01:41:34,921 --> 01:41:36,171
Evacuate!

1149
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:38,755
Come on, captain.

1150
01:41:51,505 --> 01:41:53,421
Stay with me. We're going up.

1151
01:42:18,463 --> 01:42:19,588
<i>Captain...</i>

1152
01:42:20,671 --> 01:42:22,421
<i>Captain, Chanteraide here.</i>

1153
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:25,505
<i>If you hear me...</i>

<i>You always trusted me.</i>

1155
01:42:29,171 --> 01:42:30,546
<i>Trust me one last time.</i>

1156
01:42:31,505 --> 01:42:33,838
I beg you, do not launch a missile.

1157
01:42:34,713 --> 01:42:36,796
<i>It would be a grievous error.</i>

1158
01:42:43,713 --> 01:42:45,921
<i>Most likely, these are my last words.</i>

1159
01:42:49,213 --> 01:42:50,838
<i>I hear the wolf's call.</i>

1160
01:42:55,046 --> 01:42:56,463
Farewell, captain.

1161
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:28,838
Take it.
