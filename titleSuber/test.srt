Territorial disputes in East Asian waters continue to intensify

Kaledoruf, an island country located in East Asian waters

Established a national community named after the East Asian Federation

East Asian Federation incites radical nationalism

00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:09,000
Advocating the restoration of territories and the development of maritime forces

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:09,000
The crisis of military conflicts off the coast of Japan is also approaching

12
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:26,200

There are 20 ships, so many

00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,170
I don’t look like a serious fishing boat, it’s bound for Chudao

20
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,470
Captain, if those ships move on

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,390
May cross the water boundary into the territorial waters

22
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,360
Request support from the headquarters

23
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,380

Go to the scene urgently

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,560
The fishing boat suddenly opened fire at 3:24 in the morning

The crew of the fishing boat boarded Hatsushima

The maritime security officers may have been detained

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,510
There is also news that a flag like a national flag has been raised in the middle of the island

Does it mean that Hatsushima is occupied?

Armed forces disguised as fishermen

Isn't it the East Asian Federation?

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,770

3 years ago they unilaterally announced the founding of the nation

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,460
There is no international common sense

57
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,910

If they really came to take Hatsushima

62
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,360
I have issued an order for maritime security operations

63
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,300
Prime Minister, in this situation, you should order the defense to be deployed.

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,670
First determine the identity and purpose of the illegal lander

68
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,940
Minister of Foreign Affairs, please check with relevant countries

69
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,080
And file a complaint with the United Nations

Main specifications of the aircraft-mounted frigate DDV192 Ibuki

right

93
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:07,160
Owning this is obviously against the constitution in our country

94
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,960
What do you say

95
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,800
No, Ibuki is just for defensive purposes

96
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,200
Is a means of self-defense

97
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,360
against war

98
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,670
No aircraft carrier

99
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,460
No aircraft carrier

against war

101
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,930
This is against the constitution

Configure Ibuki to ensure air superiority

105
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,060
By no means to break away from the purpose of defensive defense

106
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,730
I am sure that I will not disappoint the people's expectations

107
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,960
Against war offensive

108
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,260
Captain, the commander is looking for you

109
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,900
Please go back to the battle information center

110
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,270
understood

111
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,860
Captain Ibuki Ryota Akizu 1 Sa

112
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,790
Sure enough, did the above ask for maritime security operations?

113
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,250
I don't know where the other party is yet

114
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,000
Xinbo, it's difficult to deploy defense

115
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,500
If it is the East Asian Federation

116
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,170
The number of weapons and personnel flowing through the peninsula should not be underestimated

117
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,400
It used to be the station of the US military

118
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
So familiar with the operation of the army

119
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,200
If they have calculated that we will be dispatched

120
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,200
Must have been calculated

121
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,260
If you want to kill Japan

122
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,940
Then they must really want Ibuki’s combat power data

123
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,300
They will take the initiative to attack us

124
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,100
Ensuring the aviation advantage of the sea area is the most important

125
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,170
Having said that, at this time we have visitors on board

126
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,020
Captain Akitsu was originally the ace pilot of the Air Self-Defense Force, right?

127
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,450
I did fly a fighter jet

128
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,230
So why did you become the captain of the aircraft carrier again?

129
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,380
Should imitate the tradition of the US military

130
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,920
The fighter pilot serves as the captain of the aircraft carrier

131
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,700
But for the conflicting viewpoints that aircraft carriers are strategic weapons and specialized defenses

132
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,910
What do you think?

133
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,980
Does Japan need Ibuki

134
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,760
This is not a question I should answer

135
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,340
Please let me hear your thoughts as a captain

136
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,430
Not a question I should answer

137
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,300
So early

138
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,410
Good morning

139
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,820
early

140
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,860
Just do it before breakfast

141
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,640
The gap between us and online media is really getting bigger

142
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,380
Your Toho Shimbun is so famous, why is it humble?

143
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,880
Is this the interview yesterday

144
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,560
Yes, there is no gain at all

145
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,060
After all, this ship was controversial before it sailed.

146
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,700
So I want us to interview to gain people’s understanding

147
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,880
However, the captain didn’t mean to cooperate at all

148
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,040
But the deputy captain is very kind

149
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,880
Those two were classmates from the Defense University, they were vying for the first place.

150
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,290
Then on to Ibuki, Mr. Shinba of the Maritime Self-Defense Force is the deputy captain.

151
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,860
Mr. Qiuzu of the Air Self-Defense Force became the captain

152
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,900
So there should be some reason, right

153
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,400
That's it

154
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,630
All relevant countries have denied any connection with this matter

155
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,510
Because there is no formal diplomatic window with the East Asian Federation

156
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,320
We are currently in contact with them through a third country

157
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,570
Prime Minister Our country is under invasion

158
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,440
Shouldn't we take strong and resolute measures?

159
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,650
It feels very inconvenient to wear this action

160
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,280
You can't play golf here, right?

161
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,220
That's true

162
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,140
Safety must be considered

163
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,620
Yes

164
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,320
Please wear this when you leave the room

165
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,420
okay, I get it

166
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,300
By the way, the maritime security operation was carried out because something happened?

167
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,950
I'll explain this to you later

168
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,380
Actually let us run into a security operation in Shanghai

169
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,880
Nothing is luckier than this

170
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,360
Since the establishment of the Self-Defense Forces, this order has only been issued three times.

171
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,840
Mr. Yokoyama, right

172
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,030
You deserve to be a reporter from University of Tanaka

173
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,920
I really know the Self-Defense Forces

174
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,000
Isn't that said?

175
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,080
Only 2 of us out of 100 media

176
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,260
Such good luck is still going on

177
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,730
Stop the interview or something, please forgive me

178
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,190
I'm sorry because this is no longer a sailing exercise

179
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,420
Please try not to leave this non-commissioned officer preparation room

180
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,710
Flipper No. 1 calls the Ibuki Battle Information Center

181
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,900
A fishing boat sends out a rescue signal on the course

182
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,560
Flipper

183
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,770
Which country’s ship sent the rescue signal

184
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,170
Unable to confirm

185
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,610
Is it related to the first island landing?

186
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,420
Commander, please give an anti-submarine alert order

187
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,840
not

188
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,320
Combat Information Center

189
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,390
Missile launch sound is detected, it’s a submarine

190
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,450
15 nautical miles ahead of the fleet at 10 o'clock

191
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,330
Did you call me suddenly?

192
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,770
Was ambushed

193
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,860
There are 12 missiles

194
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,290
Aihawk interceptor missile

195
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:51,950
That's too late

196
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,250
The artillery commander fires jamming bombs to respond to the near defense system

197
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,720
Air combat begins, intercepting near defense system, launching jamming bomb

198
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,980
The target distance of 2500 is about to enter the range of the close defense system

199
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,480
shooting

200
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,980
A missile strikes

201
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,110
Everyone prevents shocks

202
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,160
what

203
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,490
Release water release water

204
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Put out the fire. Deck equipment caught fire. Ask for support

205
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Prevent the fire from spreading and bypass it

206
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,500
No way, please support

207
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,960
Was hit by a missile and exploded

208
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,020
This is the Chief of Emergency

209
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,090
Shot behind the deck and broke a hole

210
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,680
Damaged aircraft lifts and electrical systems

211
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,260
Neither lift can move

212
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,280
How long does it take to repair

213
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,000
24 hours not fast, 20 hours

214
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,740
Please fix it within 12 hours

215
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,010
Can't the carrier-based aircraft be dispatched until it is repaired?

216
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,480
Please, it's okay, cheer up

217
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,910
A Island A Island

218
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,110
Go to the cafeteria, don't panic

219
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,460
Chief Medical Officer Chief Medical Officer

220
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,260
Are you injured?

221
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,260
No

222
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,210
what happened

223
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,120
It's okay. It's safe in the room

224
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,760
Please go in please go in

225
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,560
Please, please, go in, please go in

226
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,360
Isn't this being attacked?

227
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,340
The submarine that attacked Ibuki escaped from the sea area at the scene

228
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,540
The fishing boat also disappeared

229
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,620
Prime Minister, this is the level of defense deployment, right?

230
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,660
The new mobile unit is approaching the waters of the Boriu Islands

231
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,110
Mobile force

232
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,850
The Northern Fleet of the East Asian Federation is based on the aircraft carrier Gilxia

233
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,360
It really is the East Asian Federation

234
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,250
The prime minister, let's give the defense dispatch order.

235
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,580
Prime Minister

236
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,580
They sent an aircraft carrier

237
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,340
The appearance looks like an old antique from a former communist country

238
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,880
The internal structure is upgraded

239
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,040
There are several carrier-based aircraft

240
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,810
MiG-35 60

241
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,660
The air-to-sea alert level is raised to strict

242
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,620
This is tricky

243
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,740
commander

244
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,520
Use a helicopter to transfer the reporters to the supply ship heading south.

245
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,300
Ok this is better

246
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,880
Ship sentinel, third deployment, first sentinel

247
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,430
satellite telephone?

248
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,920
I can’t use my phone at sea, so I told me to take it

249
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,880
But you can’t send messages without permission

250
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,660
Yes

251
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,880
Good morning

252
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,790
Good morning

253
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,000
Good morning

254
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Good morning

255
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,980
Good morning

256
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,940
Good morning

257
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,460
Good morning

258
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,040
Miss Shaigu

259
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,790
Someone posted this video on the Internet not long ago

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,520
what

261
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,780
You are also very beautiful today

262
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,330
Thank you

263
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,320
Seems something is burning

264
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,230
Asked the Coast Guard

265
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,180
No news of fires and accidents in large ships

266
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
Know the location

267
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,280
Have location information

268
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,400
About 400 kilometers west of the Ogasawara Islands

269
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,440
Zoom in

270
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,160
Yes

271
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,680
19

272
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,350
Huh, do you want to interview again?

273
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,650
Mr. Fujitang, you really like boats

274
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,790
Is it Ichu?

275
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,380
Haven't we been in the Maritime Self-Defense Force special episode?

276
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,940
Look at DDV192 Ichu

277
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,900
DDV192 Ibuki

278
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,900
Aircraft-mounted frigate

279
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,900
The first aircraft-mounted frigate after the war

280
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,900
The largest vessel of the Maritime Self-Defense Force 248m

281
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,600
No way

282
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,280
Damn

283
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,480
Ah, she's on this ship right now

284
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,290
Just above

285
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,780
On top, Yuko

286
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,670
interviewing

287
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,670
Vice President Bates

288
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,430
Regarding this unfair aggression against us

289
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,480
We intend to retake the territory immediately

290
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:40,060
I will convey it to the president who is attending the US-China-Russia trilateral meeting

291
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,440
But I hope you can restrain yourself

292
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,500
of course

293
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,840
But we may have to use your country’s power as an ally

294
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,360
I will convey it to Mr. President good luck

295
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,170
Sonar buoy contact found submarine

296
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,410
20 miles ahead of the fleet, 320 depth

297
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,900
No response to identification signal

298
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,320
The commander is a submarine of the East Asian Federation

299
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,520
On the heading to Boriu

300
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,250
If we go straight, will there be a fight?

301
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,100
Yes

302
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:31,440
In this case, our challenge is inevitable

303
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,850
Should be avoided

304
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,780
Do not

305
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,830
Should go straight

306
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,450
This battle is also a battle against time

307
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,420
If the enemy completes the defensive deployment

308
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,200
Whether you want to recapture Hatsushima or rescue the maritime security officer

309
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,860
Will become more difficult

310
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,670
But in that case

311
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,320
To succumb to threats or to fight

312
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,900
The test is our consciousness

313
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,840
Have you finished your two opinions?

314
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,250
Yes

315
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,550
it is good

316
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,310
straight

317
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:27,760
All members enter combat positions Repeat All members enter combat positions

318
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,760
What are you fighting with?

319
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,180
Faster

320
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,650
Yes

321
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,560
Emergency closing of the cabin door

322
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,260
Drive to the front of Ibuki at maximum speed

323
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,930
Maximum speed

324
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,480
Maximum speed

325
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,750
The artillery commander prepares to fight against the submarine

326
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,780
Preparation for launch of submarine missile

327
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,140
Ready to launch

328
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,650
The sound of the torpedo tube opening

329
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,520
Are you going to do it here?

330
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,080
The morning tide also opened the torpedo tube

331
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,000
Captain Qiujin, what's your judgment?

332
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,010
The enemy's finger is already pulling the trigger

333
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,460
We can avoid torpedoes in the sea

334
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,390
But it’s dangerous to face the morning tide at close range

335
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,880
If we do not act, we will be attacked

336
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,320
I think the current situation meets the conditions of the attack

337
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,520
Our mission is maritime security operations

338
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,940
Except for legitimate defense, we cannot attack actively

339
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,130
Obviously the current state of affairs is that we have been improperly violated

340
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,760
Once you do it, it's war

341
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,910
This is the obstacle we have to overcome

342
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,200
2 miles away

343
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,740
2 minutes to reach the goal

344
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,380
Commander, please give an attack order

345
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,200
If you sink an enemy submarine

346
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,910
Not only will it affect the safety of Hatsushima’s marine protection team

347
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,780
Will also create new excuses for the enemy to attack

348
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,280
Do you want the morning tide ship as a living sacrifice?

349
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,090
I didn't say that

350
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,580
Trust the control skills of Captain Taki and his crew

351
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,120
Alright

352
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,390
We are not allowed to fire a bullet before the enemy fires

353
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,080
Keep attacking and keep going

354
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,260
Keep attacking and keep going

355
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,560
Maintain course and speed

356
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,530
Commander commander

357
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,660
Send the commander to the infirmary

358
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,590
stretcher

359
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,300
commander

360
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,640
Stretcher, hurry up

361
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,690
Commander, are you okay?

362
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,460
1 minute to reach directly above the target

363
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,340
15 seconds

364
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,230
10 seconds

365
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,310
Pass directly above the enemy submarine

366
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,140
Didn't you call?

367
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,960
The fleet broke through the predicted line of attack

368
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,400
Ah great

369
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,820
The enemy submarine’s course turned northeast and disengaged

370
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,090
If everything is calm in the future

371
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,030
The Ibuki will reach the waters of Kurume at 24:00 as planned

372
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,690
They do well

373
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,350
The nature of our country’s defense is not to evade. They showed this

374
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,820
You are consequential

375
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,820
If the enemy opens fire, I am afraid now

376
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,820
Prime Minister

377
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,660
We should immediately order the defense to attack

378
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,170
However, Commander Wakui was seriously injured and unable to continue his command.

379
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,040
Who will be the commander from now on

380
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,540
Command will be transferred to Ibuki Captain Akizu Kazusa

381
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,240
Akitsu

382
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,390
This is Captain Akizu Kazusa

383
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,910
I'm Qiujin, who is instructed to take over

384
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,450
It is said that you are the youngest person to be promoted to Izuo

385
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,700
It’s very hard to transfer from the Air Self-Defense Force to the Maritime Self-Defense Force.

386
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,070
Are you still used to it?

387
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,180
Once people get new toys, they will be eager to try

388
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:38,360
It depends on whether the people who master it have firm mental preparation

389
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,820
The warship that invested 300 billion in heavy taxes is a toy in his mouth

390
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,890
Your idea is correct

391
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:16,780
I hurt my ears, it feels like the sky is spinning, so troublesome

392
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,040
Akitsu Kazusa

393
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,200
I hand over the command of the Fifth Guard Group to you

394
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,160
Yes

395
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,050
As you wish

396
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,280
Next time they will attack

397
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,600
We must overcome this obstacle anyway

398
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,740
What obstacle

399
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,170
For those who try to violate our sovereignty

400
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,690
Be prepared to face off

401
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,830
So I don't escape

402
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,060
Let the other party see our will to defend the country

403
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,150
Will definitely die

404
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:18,820
Since its establishment, it is the pride of our Self-Defense Force that no one died

405
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,680
wrong

406
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,170
What we are proud of is not that the Self-Defense Force did not have any dead

407
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:32,620
It’s that in the decades after the war, no one died because of the war.

408
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,690
If you die to protect the people

409
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Isn't this the long-cherished wish of the self-defense officer?

410
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,550
Intervention in the tripartite containment of the United States, China and Russia

411
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,920
See if we can get results that are beneficial to us

412
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,100
Sawasaki

413
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,620
Is the opponent’s purpose only to occupy Poliujian and make it a fait accompli?

414
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,010
Restoration of the territory of the Kaledoruf Dynasty

415
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,620
It is a convention that supports the military regime of the East Asian Federation

416
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,780
But things will not be so simple

417
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,110
Good or bad

418
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,400
The world's dominant country has lost its original status

419
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,360
Let national firstism spread all over the world

420
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,340
Caused the rise of nationalist countries like the East Asian Federation

421
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,800
But the armaments expanded so fast

422
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,760
They can't do it on their own

423
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,820
In other words, is there a country that is behind it?

424
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,920
If you manipulate it behind your back, you can make the other party invisible

425
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,960
Indeed, our country’s national strength and combat power are stronger than the East Asian Federation

426
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,700
But if we enter a total war

427
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,540
Both sides will be fatally injured

428
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,520
Sawazaki Yusaku

429
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,520
Director, Asian and Oceanian Bureau, Ministry of Foreign Affairs

430
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,310
On the territorial issue

431
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,630
If Japan cannot maintain the status quo

432
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,590
May be unavoidable

433
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,460
But if not handled properly

434
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,240
The war will spread to Asia, not the whole world

435
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,840
The next 24 hours is the key

436
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,990
Yes

437
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,900
Thank you slow walk

438
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,150
Thank you

439
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,140
Shop manager, let me do it

440
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,060
Great

441
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,180
Look, the boots for Christmas candy are sold out

442
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,840
Replenishment is hard to come

443
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,600
I must step up now

444
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,580
I will concentrate on this

445
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,140
Yes

446
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,360
That Xiaojing

447
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,530
Can i ask you for tomorrow night shift

448
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,690
what

449
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,690
Oops, Yasuo got the flu

450
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,690
Can't it? It's Christmas Eve after all

451
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,720
Isn't that okay? After all, tomorrow is Christmas Eve

452
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,890
I have no problem

453
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:17,960
Yeah, I knew you would agree

454
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,900
Thank you, I went to make boots

455
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,780
I'll leave it to you outside

456
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,390
Hotan, Hotan, please

457
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,110
Yes Yes

458
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,490
Oh, go here a little bit more, put your heart in order

459
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,780
-Yes-Please

460
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,800
Captain, Hatsushima is ahead

461
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,080
Radar contact 1-9-0

462
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,150
16 Angle 10 is approaching

463
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,260
Only at this distance did it detect that it should be a stealth machine

464
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,260
If it’s the East Asian Federation, it’s the MiG-35.

465
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,260
Visually confirm the target

466
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,650
Warning It is forbidden to fly over Hatsushima

467
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,930
Please evacuate from this airspace immediately

468
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,370
Do not make jokes

469
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,680
Is it you who invaded the air?

470
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,560
Naha Command Center, this is Doug 2

471
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,500
I got a warning shot

472
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,890
Doug 2 This is the Naha Command Center

473
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,600
Please make a U-turn and return, repeat, please return to base immediately

474
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,000
Receive and return immediately

475
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,040
But to complete your mission to shoot Hatsushima

476
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,010
understand

477
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,680
Radar wave detected

478
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,550
We are locked and call here

479
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,400
It's a missile, turn right and maneuver to evade!

480
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,040
Doug 2 Please answer this is the Naha Command Center

481
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,320
Repeat Doug 2 Please answer this is the Naha Command Center

482
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,220
Doug 2 please answer

483
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,380
The dead?

484
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,970
Is the message sure?

485
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,880
A reconnaissance plane of the Air Self-Defense Force was shot down

486
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,370
Unable to confirm whether the pilot escaped

487
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,040
I'm afraid the chance of survival is slim

488
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,920
Prime Minister should have fully satisfied the conditions now

489
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,360
If you don’t make up your mind, this battle will be lost.

490
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,120
Prime Minister

491
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:42,640
Prime Minister

492
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:07,340
Japanese territory is being invaded

493
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,170
It is already certain that we were attacked by force

494
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,950
After the Minister of Defense obtained the consent of all cabinet members

495
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,940
Seek the consent of Congress afterwards

496
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,280
Now order all the troops of the Self-Defense Force to be deployed

497
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,160
Yes

498
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,200
Minister of Foreign Affairs, now contact the UN quickly

499
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,220
To report that our country will exercise its right of self-defense

500
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,500
understood

501
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,770
Captain Ibuki gave orders to each ship

502
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,380
The defense is dispatched!

503
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,620
This is not a drill

504
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,840
repeat

505
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,400
Defence dispatched

506
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,420
Raise the level of air and submarine alert to strict

507
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:46,090
Order the defense to be dispatched!

508
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,200
What is the defense?

509
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,530
This is incredible

510
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,530
-This is a fighting condition-Is this the first time

511
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:59,660
Yes, this is the first time we ordered the use of force after World War II

512
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,070
Is there going to be a war? Isn't this ship dangerous?

513
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,870
It's okay, it's okay, the boat is so big

514
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:13,700
Generally speaking, war and battle are not the same

515
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,730
-What's the difference? -Eh

516
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,760
Japan has always believed that peace can be maintained even without the use of force

517
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,980
Am I going to be the first prime minister to discover that this is just a fantasy

518
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,440
Shi Du, how can I bear this responsibility?

519
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:52,000
I will guard the peace and independence of our country

520
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,390
Take on the mission of the Self-Defense Force

521
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,180
Compliance with the Japanese Constitution and laws

522
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,450
Unity and strict discipline

523
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:10,440
Chongde Shangzhi Respect for personality

524
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,520
Strengthen fitness, improve skills

525
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,160
Not participating in political activities

526
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,010
Concentrate on performing duties with a strong sense of responsibility

527
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,180
-Don't be afraid of danger-Don't be afraid of danger

528
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,960
Dedicate yourself to your mission

529
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,640
Live up to the national trust

530
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,500
I swear

531
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,280
The pilot who fell from the sky above Boriu

532
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,630
At the moment of being hit by a missile

533
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,660
Must be reciting this vow silently

534
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,740
I must avenge the two of them

535
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,700
Yuanshang

536
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,250
If you go to the battlefield with this kind of thought, you will be blinded

537
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:01,810
Yes

538
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,760
We are not going to avenge the enemy

539
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
If we must use strength to make them understand

540
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,320
Their military operations to invade our Asian territorial waters

541
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:15,190
If you are so arrogant, reckless and stupid, tell them with your strength

542
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,950
The defense was deployed to prove our strength

543
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,260
The deck is 248 meters long

544
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,870
There are 720 members serving on this ship

545
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,610
In this fighter

546
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,940
With 60 barrels of fuel

547
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,690
Haven't seen the smoke yet

548
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,560
Yes

549
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,930
I can't get in touch anymore

550
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,600
Is it shut down?

551
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,230
Ok

552
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,280
-Fujitang-Yes

553
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,590
-Please sort out Ibuki's information.-Okay

554
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,100
Just use the existing materials to make another special

555
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,120
-I see.-The interest of users has been hooked.

556
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,380
It is our job to make them interested

557
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,370
"Japan's first aircraft carrier Ibuki"

558
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,870
"The secret operation in the Pacific Ocean now reveals its full story"

559
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,720
You know what i want

560
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,100
Isn't it long?

561
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,520
not long

562
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:25,590
Holler

563
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,900
The shop manager has already booked all the chicken for Christmas

564
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,180
-Manager.-I was scared to death

565
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,040
Scared me

566
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,360
Sorry sorry

567
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,170
I brought earplugs for concentration

568
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,230
what happened? Ah scared me

569
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,600
That one

570
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,740
The chicken for Christmas has all been reserved

571
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,740
How much do I need to order more

572
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,140
30...ah, not 50 copies.

573
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,380
Ok

574
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,510
This is really a sweet trouble

575
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,760
It’s been sold out in recent years

576
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,280
300 must be done by tomorrow morning, otherwise it’s too late

577
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,560
Which one do you want this

578
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,030
The sound of the propeller is detected

579
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,450
One o'clock direction distance 5 miles depth 600

580
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,340
Are you those guys again?

581
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,000
No, this is the Schmidt class of the U.S. Navy

582
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,740
Behind is the Russian Alpha

583
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,610
I'm afraid that the nuclear-powered submarines of Britain and France are nearby

584
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,730
Are all countries listening to the truth?

585
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,110

It's MiG. What's the distance now?

591
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,210
According to our fleet there are 400 miles

592
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,570
It’s about 20 minutes before reaching the enemy’s missile range.

Don't give up, can't let him die

665
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,310
excuse me

666
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,830
How's it? Are you okay?

667
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,560
What was the explosion sound just now?

668
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,480
It's loud, isn't it serious

669
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,860
Only the sound is really scary

670
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,850
What's only sound

671
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,500
In addition, you two will take about 20 minutes

672
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,140
Please disembark

673
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,480
-Isn’t it two days as planned?-I’m getting off the boat

674
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,070
-Eh? -I want to disembark

675
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,940
-What good

676
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:39,080
Unsure of the survival of the pilot

677
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,750
Repeat Unable to determine the survival of the pilot

678
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,720
Our Self-Defense Force shot down an enemy plane for the first time

679
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,000
Took the life of the pilot

680
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,680
Now that the order for the defense has been given, this is a matter of course.

681
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:55,590
You said it

682
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,000
But there is no hesitation

683
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,140
Shinha Jisa

684
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,770
Have power

685
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:07,720
It is to be used without fear when necessary

686
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,910
We have destroyed two missiles launched by the enemy plane

687
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,270
Is it necessary to launch further attacks

688
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,940
The pilot will understand

689
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,820
Shot down?

690
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,670
The pilot was not rescued

691
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,100
is it

692
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,320
Cheer up

693
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,130
The highest commander of the Self-Defense Forces is you, Prime Minister

694
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,810
-This is different from what I said.-What

695
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,300
This doesn’t mean giving up the interview

696
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,000
Situation has changed

697
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:20,300
We have nothing. How are the injured people?

698
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,630
It's okay, please get on the helicopter and leave the ship early

699
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,110
Every time you say it's okay

700
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,660
It's okay, I said it's okay

701
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,050
Who said it’s okay? Don’t you want to send us back?

702
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,650
It’s dangerous on the deck. Go up.

703
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,620
-No, because-look

704
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,440
Miss Bendo Miss Bendo

705
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,270
Captain, let me ask you again

706
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,180
Does Japan need an aircraft carrier?

707
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,860
This is not a question I should answer

708
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:01,110
We must report what is happening here at this moment

709
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:06,440
Please let us stay on the boat

710
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,560
The next control will be stricter than before

711
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,720
-Why should I say that?-What

712
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:53,520
Japan's first aircraft carrier Ibuki

713
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:53,580
The secret operation in the Pacific Ocean is now fully revealed

714
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,230
Thank you

715
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,620
Yuzi will be fine, right?

716
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,630
She is not only in good health, but also has a strong heart

717
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,950
It's Christmas already

718
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,100
-Fujitang-Yes

719
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,200
If you think so, you lose

720
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,560
Sorry

721
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:35,500
Stopped the music

722
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,130
Sorry

723
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,680
I came in to rest

724
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,050
-Oh, you worked hard. -You worked hard

725
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,800
I have a headache in what order to put the chocolate in

726
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:59,730
This Dutch one is delicious

727
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,860
But this Brazilian is also delicious

728
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,900
Ah this?

729
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,260
I plan to use this as Santa’s souvenir

730
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,110
Write a letter and put it in

731
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:17,380
Kids will be happy

732
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,920
You like everyone, everyone will like you too

733
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,990
Hush hush, don't make a noise

734
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,910
Why are you reading it out?

735
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,420
-What's this?-Let go

736
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,860
Put it in, put it in, put it all in

737
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,060
-Even if not today...-Why did you take it again

738
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,560
Emergency telegram received

739
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,230
Put down the antenna

complete

745
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,420
Does it mean to avoid expanding from battle to war?

746
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,680
So what kind of scale is war?

747
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,480
Not only our self-defense officer is involved

748
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,880
When casualties spread to ordinary citizens

749
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,980
It's war

750
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,070
Try to avoid fighting

You're here again

755
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,110
The enemy ship opened the torpedo tube

756
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:51,600
-Open the launch tube? -It will definitely be launched this time

757
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:54,430
If you don’t kill it, Ibuki will be killed by it.

758
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:05,340
Captain, the enemy hasn't found us yet

759
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,000
The enemy ship has not changed its direction and is accelerating

Love Eagle Calls Ibuki

768
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,680
The enemy submarine fired 4 torpedoes at us

00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,820
Deputy Captain Go to the bridge to operate the warship

770
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,820
(Bridge: It is located on the slightly higher deck in the middle of the warship, and is the command center in the ship)

771
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:40,420
Yes

772
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,040
Ibuki calls the ships

773
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,820
Fight submarine to avoid torpedoes

774
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,260
No one is allowed

775

-Facing torpedo, left full rudder -left full rudder

778
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,810
No. 3 and No. 4 launch inducer bomb

779
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,000
It's okay, okay, okay?

780
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,870
Mr. Tanaka is all right

781
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,990
Ah i'm fine

782
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,960
If the enemy torpedo is confused by the inducer,

783
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,500
Still get some time

784
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,000
Captain, if we don’t stop the next attack,

785
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,840
Iphone is dangerous

786
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:52,380
If you attack now, you can sink the enemy submarine.

787
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,920
If you attack, 150 enemy crew members will lose their lives.

788
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,220
but

789
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,340
Stop launch

790
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:06,570

792
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,020
OK, keep going straight

801
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,060
Are you planning to bump into it to stop the second wave of attacks?

802
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:02,800
If the operation is not good, a total of 300 people will sink to the sea floor

00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,840
Morning tide rises 5 meters

811
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,580
The enemy submarine began evasive action

812
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:56,360
Trim the bow while turning the rudder

813
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,220

828
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,640
Personnel from various positions on the port side quickly took refuge at the stern

829
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,520
Retreat quickly

830
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,240
fast!

831
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,900
Use my ship to protect Ibuki

832
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,190
Maximum speed meets torpedoes!

833
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,980
Maximum speed

834
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,110
Maximum speed

835
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,360
Port side personnel have evacuated

836
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,500
You also go to the stern for refuge

837
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,460
Seto

838
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:36,250
The torpedo is coming, forward port side

839
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,340
you guys

840
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,590
I do not care what time

841
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,290
Can't leave his post

842
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,090
This is what the captain taught us

843
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,740
The torpedo is coming

844
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:04,400
Anti-shock preparation

845
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:20,720
Hello wait

846
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,810
There is nothing unusual in each department, right?

847
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,220
Launch tube chamber No abnormality

848
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,520
1L without exception

849
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:30,500
Command post flooded

850
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,030
No abnormalities in the AIP room

851
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,400
No abnormality in the machine room

852
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:34,280
What about the air pump

853
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,460
Air pump No abnormality

854
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,440
Good pressurized water tank drainage

855
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,420
Pressurized water tank drainage emergency float up

856
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,660
Emergency ascent

857
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,910
The morning tide and the enemy submarine came up together

858
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:06,690
Chuxue made our shield

859
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,530
Ibuki calls Shirayuki Isokaze

860
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,460
Ask the two ships to rescue the people on Chuxue

861
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:28,640
Head towards Haruma in two hours

862
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,590
Isokaze received

863
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:35,140
Roger that

864
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,700
Listen well, try to help Chuxue

865
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,700
Get ready for amphibious boat

866
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,090
Prepare amphibious boat

867
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,260
Prepare amphibious boat

868
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,430
Prepare amphibious boat

869
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,210
Where's the first snow

870
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:53,880
It's on fire, but Ibuki is fine

871
00:58:57,350 --> 00:59:00,620
Please, Ibuki

872
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,960
The frigate's first snow is burning

873
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,380
Let's go back

874
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,430
The morning tide is heading towards Kure alone

875
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:02,000
The first snow can no longer sail, and many people were seriously injured.

876
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,730
Ibuki left Shirayuki to take care of the wounded

877
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,380
Head towards Hatsushima with Aihawk Isokaze

878
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,410
The participants of the UN Security Council have been assembled

879
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,980
Emergency meeting in three hours

880
01:00:16,690 --> 01:00:17,880
is it

881
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:24,150
The self-defense officers at the battle scene have ordered the defense to be deployed

882
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,100
Still insist on special defense

883
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,100
(Dedicated defense: only use force around the domain to defend yourself when you are under attack)

884
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,640
Prime Minister, two ships have already been attacked

885
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,690
Now we should send reinforcements to defeat the opponent

886
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,640
Fujido

887
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:49,520
coming

888
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:50,720
From Yuko

889
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:52,660
-Eh what-what

890
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,500
Eh

891
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,500
Shaigu, news

892
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:04,230
-What is this-what, let me see

893
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,720
The frigate Hatsuki is burning

894
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:14,580
Nothing else

895
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,440
Yuzi, are you okay?

896
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,340
Hurry up and load emergency supplies on the helicopter

897
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:24,320
Repeat

898
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,690
Hurry up and load emergency supplies on the helicopter

899
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,450
Can i use this

900
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:38,540
Since I didn't get permission, I was also an accomplice

901
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,730
But this is the headline

902
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,800
When the report comes out, the society will be a mess

903
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,200
-Please.-Okay

904
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,110
-Thank you -Please come here next

905
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:01,940
Grandma Xiaolin bought so many things today

906
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,870
I told you it's going to fight

907
01:02:04,350 --> 01:02:05,370
fight?

908
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,590
-Hurry up-ok

909
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:10,520
Not ok yet

910
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,800
Isn't it true? Is this true?

911
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:24,230
Prime Minister, the issue of Iki was posted on the Internet

912
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,920
what

913
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,540
Hey

914
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,130
How could it become like this

915
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:34,610
Deleted let them delete

916
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:35,120
Yes

917
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,310
Hold a press conference

918
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,860
No Prime Minister...

919
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:44,660
This video will definitely panic the public

920
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,000
Will there be a press conference later?

921
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,850
Now that it has happened

922
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:50,960
The top priority now is to gain the understanding and support of the people

923
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,290
If something goes wrong, the cabinet will be easily dissolved

924
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:57,090
Should we send reinforcements before the reception?

925
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,950
If you don’t use the force of the whole army to repel the enemy in one breath

926
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,710
We will really lose this war

927
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,400
Shiroyama

928
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:13,250
After World War II, a large number of politicians decided the direction of our country

929
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:19,170
Even though there are many discussions and complaints

930
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:25,060
They are united to stick to one thing

931
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:31,030
That is this country, Japan will never go to war

932
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:32,350
This is an agreement with the people

933
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,820
I hope you don’t use the word war lightly

934
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,380
Chief Cabinet Secretary is preparing to hold a press conference

935
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,380
(The Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan is equivalent to the Secretary-General of the Government)

936
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,010
Yes

937
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:58,340
What a shocking video

938
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,570
I'm glad you showed our work status to the outside world

939
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:07,740
But I didn’t get permission to send the image, which violated the rules

940
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:14,060
I can only keep the satellite phone temporarily

941
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,830
By the way, wear your life jacket well

942
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:30,300
Ok

943
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:37,100
15 seriously injured

944
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:37,100
There was an explosion and fire near the bow of the ship

945
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:37,100
Chuxue shot near the bow

946
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:37,100
Multiple minor injuries (the number is still being confirmed)

947
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,450
A report from Chuxue

948
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:45,460
Many people were slightly injured 15 people were seriously injured

949
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,530
2 more people died

950
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:51,650
what

951
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:56,380
You say killed?

952
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:58,760
Who

953
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,360
Still confirming

954
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:10,140
Convey Captain Seto

955
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,100
Do a good job in the treatment of the crew and repair of the ship

956
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,700
Take the seriously injured who can move by helicopter to Okinotori Island

957
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:23,030
Captain Seto was seriously injured and now the deputy captain is in command

958
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,900
That's it, then pass it to the deputy captain

959
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:29,720
Yes

960
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:49,710
I buy this for my granddaughter at the nearby convenience store every year

961
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:53,200
She looks forward to this every year

962
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,920
Her name is Xiao Shang

963
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,790
I was going to wait for the interview to end

964
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:59,770
Just brought it back to her

965
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:04,740
I didn't expect these to be broken

966
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,280
Shall you eat it?

967
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,370
I'll buy it for my granddaughter

968
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:29,540
Everyone is good friend

969
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:29,540
The world is one home

970
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:28,490
That paragraph is well written

971
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:51,150
As long as you smile, everyone will be happy

972
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:51,150
Everyone is happy because of your smile

973
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:51,150
What's unhappy, let's face it together

974
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:51,150
Dreams will come true as long as there are dreams

975
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:53,650
There are two enemy ships ahead. They are destroyers.

976
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:58,040
Bearing 190 and 45 miles away

977
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,650
Driving to Hatsushima

978
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:03,040
This is determined to intercept us

979
01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:07,460
If it’s the Northern Fleet of the East Asian Federation, it’s Russa and Sligo.

980
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,010
Both ships are equipped with YJ95 anti-ship missiles

981
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:14,890
These two ships must be rendered ineffective

982
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:19,510
-Short-range defense weapon system Check fuel-Understand

983
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:24,010
I think Isokaze should take the lead

984
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:28,330
It’s safer to sink them with the Harpoon anti-ship missile.

985
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,140
If you use a harpoon, the ship will sink

986
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,000
The two ships together have 600 crew members

987
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:48,810
Do you want to take the lives of all of them

988
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:56,880
In this case, there is no doubt that the enemy will use this as an opportunity to expand the front

989
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:06,430
It would also violate the command of the command "avoid fighting that affects diplomatic negotiations"

990
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,680
I blame the reporter for leaking the news and inciting people’s anxiety

991
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,710
Since it is the Northern Fleet of East Asia

992
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:19,790
That should also be equipped

993
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:21,790
Long-range missiles that can snipe Japan from the sea

994
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:26,430
Judging from the situation so far, they cannot be judged by common sense

995
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:28,910
International law makes no sense to them

996
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,730
If you stimulate them again

997
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,570
In case you hurt the nation

998
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,440
Then it will trigger the war you call

999
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:50,710
Our Self-Defense Force exists to avoid war

1000
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:54,570
Our judgment will be the fuse of the war

1001
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:57,330
As a self-defense player

1002
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,070
Do not

1003
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,600
As a crew member

1004
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,600
I can't agree

1005
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,290
The enemy ship is coming

1006
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:42,360
How about Isokaze’s main gun, Deputy Captain?

1007
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:46,720
So it won’t sink the enemy ship

1008
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,170
Main gun

1009
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:03,070
Try it

1010
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:07,330
Main gun?

1011
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:10,170
Be sure to show me when you were a gunner in Pufeng

1012
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:16,650
The ability to take first place many times in military competition

1013
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,050
Don't have to wear a high hat for me

1014
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,780
I'll do what you want me to do

1015
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:24,480
understand

1016
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,430
Enemy destroyer

1017
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:34,420
Speed ​​25 nautical miles 35 miles away

1018
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:37,790
The ship’s main gun has a range of 20 miles

1019
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:41,150
5 miles longer than the opponent’s main gun

1020
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:42,710
Make good use of this gap

1021
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,290
Indeed, if the main gun is used

1022
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:46,660
Can minimize the damage to enemy ships

1023
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,780
But the range is only 20 miles, we will also enter the opponent’s radar circle

1024
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:52,000
It is very dangerous

1025
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:54,690
Didn't the headquarters order the defense to be deployed?

1026
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:56,420
Why worry about the enemy...

1027
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,280
Isn’t your usual training just for today...

1028
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,280
Don't you want to show it

1029
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,240
But the enemy will definitely launch anti-ship missiles

1030
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,660
Ah will come

1031
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:11,240
Captain, can I use extended range bombs for shelling?

1032
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,080
Extended projectile range to 60 miles

1033
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,030
-No-what

1034
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,560
The damage to the hit point will be great if the bomb is extended

1035
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:21,590
Must be close to 20 miles or so to strike

1036
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:25,940
-Here, Kansai-style.-What?

1037
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:30,040
This is a sign of your seriousness

1038
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:32,740
Oh, really

1039
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:39,000
I confiscated the satellite phone of the female reporter

1040
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,340
Isokaze, the enemy ship is 10 miles away.

1041
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:46,580
I've warned her seriously, I'm leaving now

1042
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,820
-Inoue 3 Zuo-In

1043
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,820
The ship is 40 miles away from the enemy destroyer

1044
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:56,750
Repeat, this ship is 40 miles away from the enemy destroyer

1045
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:58,470
Yes

1046
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:09,490
Now our country is being invaded by the East Asian Federation

1047
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,000
Whether it’s shooting down enemy fighters or fighting with the 5th escort

1048
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:20,630
All out of self-defense, in accordance with the constitution

1049
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:25,600
Did the Prime Minister have to hold a press conference because of Yuko's video?

1050
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:42,620
Breaking news: East Asian Federation forces occupy Hatsushima?
The Self-Defense Forces began their first defense deployment

1051
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,630
The current constitution explains the right to self-defense like this

1052
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,180
To protect the personal freedom, safety and property of our citizens

1053
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:42,300
Allow the use of the minimum necessary force

1054
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,440
Ah, that's mine

1055
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,240
give me one

1056
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,500
Except Mentaiko

1057
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,220
Can't it? Mentaiko

1058
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:50,000
Can't

1059
01:12:50,020 --> 01:12:52,830
Would you like to try my dried cheese katsuobushi?

1060
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:53,820
Not needed

1061
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:58,400
Prime Minister, this is Imai from Hyundai Daily

1062
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,450
The fighters that shot down the East Asian Federation were clearly at war

1063
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:02,960
Isn't it the use of force?

1064
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:05,280
No

1065
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,010
As i just said

1066
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:12,680
This is based on the right to self-defense

1067
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,920
Instead of exercising the right to war

1068
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,340
Oh my mentha

1069
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,340
please wait for a moment

1070
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,030
Sorry

1071
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:27,810
Hello, hurry up

1072
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,180
Sorry

1073
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:31,390
Instant noodles and water are out of stock

1074
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,690
The phone at the headquarters’ distribution center couldn’t be reached at all

1075
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:37,760
I can't go back after seeing this for a while, obviously I'm off work

1076
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,250
Just about the use of force

1077
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:48,270
The aircraft carrier Ibuki caused heated discussions!
The personnel concerned have fled abroad! ? Japan is chaotic.

1078
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:50,150
Does Japan have an aircraft carrier

1079
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:45,120
Only the minimum necessary force is allowed

1080
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:48,570
Is there going to be a war?

1081
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:51,690
Japan is over

1082
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:53,150
Terrorism is about to spread to Japan! ?

1083
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,570
Is this fake news? (laughs)

1084
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:53,990
Is the third world war going to start! ?

1085
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,800
Our government strictly abides by this regulation

1086
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:54,820
what! What about the concert that weekend?
What a shame! ! I will hate you if it is cancelled! !

1087
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:54,070
Will the United States help us?

1088
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:56,780
There is nothing in the nearby convenience store

1089
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:57,740
If this is true, it would be terrible. What should I do?

1090
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:56,780
Ibuki is on fire, the news is endless

1091
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:55,200
The East Asian Federation illegally arrested a maritime security officer

1092
01:13:51,820 --> 01:14:00,660
The aircraft carrier will be suspended if it burns

1093
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:55,660
Has the government issued any statement?

1094
01:13:54,070 --> 01:14:02,330
Haole, ready to escape

1095
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:59,910
Please the Self-Defense Forces! Hold Japan for me! !

1096
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,780
This is a super awesome video

1097
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:57,910
I've thought that there will be such a day

1098
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,770
Occupy our territory

1099
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,950
Who are you at war with?

1100
01:13:57,740 --> 01:14:04,370
My cat is also very upset

1101
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:02,790
What on earth is Prime Minister Tarimizu thinking?

1102
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:02,530
On this basis, attack the frigate of the Self-Defense Force

1103
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:01,870
An anti-war demonstration will be held in the National Diet Building at 12 tomorrow
Please participate! Together to protect peaceful Japan!

1104
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:02,790
Yeah, go abroad

1105
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:03,250
I want to know the details

1106
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:05,500
The war is too horrible, is it really being attacked by missiles?

1107
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:05,500
what! ! The war is really going to start! ?

1108
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:05,500
What did Japan learn from the Pacific War? Is the Japanese government a fool?

1109
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,500
Is there any renewal?

1110
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:10,040
Not only caused several injuries, but unfortunately several more people died

1111
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,500
Ibuki is so handsome, although it is on fire

1112
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:20,310
Until now, this is a battle that has to be fought for self-defense

1113
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,140
I am Ichinose of Toho Shimbun

1114
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:25,000
All the responses so far have been out of self-defense

1115
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,540
As a last resort

1116
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:29,320
But after that, the war will escalate and intensify

1117
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,370
If there are 100 East Asian Federation fighters attacking us

1118
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:35,170
Then we must shoot down these 100 fighters

1119
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:38,750
In turn, it will cost 100 pilots.

1120
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:41,880
Isn’t this just what the world calls war?

1121
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,390
No this is not war

1122
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:47,180
This is just a battle for self-defense from beginning to end

1123
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:52,770
It’s just that in order to prevent further development

1124
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:54,680
Tried everything

1125
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:59,220
Won't cause war again

1126
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:07,250
After the wars of the past, we and the Constitution swear together

1127
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:14,560
Don't provide people with inaccurate information to cause their misunderstanding

1128
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:17,390
Please trust our government

1129
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:25,080
Our country will never participate in war

1130
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:28,710
Prime Minister, have you ever negotiated with the East Asian Federation

1131
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:31,030
Has the East Asian Federation issued a statement

1132
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:32,460
Prime Minister, can we think

1133
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:35,430
It was the service of Ishu that triggered this incident

1134
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:36,970
Prime Minister please answer

1135
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:37,630
Prime Minister please answer

1136
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:39,400
Prime minister prime minister

1137
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,100
Prime Minister!

1138
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,250
The enemy's anti-ship missile is approaching

1139
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,120
Anti-aircraft missile ready to launch

1140
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,520
-Hit-launch

1141
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,260
The short-range SAM missile shot down two enemy missiles

1142
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:04,610
One broke through the line of defense

1143
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:07,590
It’s 10 miles away and arrives at this ship in 20 seconds.

1144
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:08,690
Short-range defense weapon system

1145
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:14,810
Confirm to shoot down all missiles

1146
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:16,230
Isn't this preventable

1147
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:18,240
How is the enemy dynamic

1148
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:21,770
The direction and speed have not changed. The two ships are approaching.

1149
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,200
20 miles from the ship

1150
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,160
Is about to enter the range of the main gun

1151
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,620
Holler, sure shelling ray

1152
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:31,300
Go around on the right side of Rusa

1153
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,720
Full right rudder

Please, Isokaze

1156
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:48,590
Already at 90 degrees of the target destroyer

1159
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:53,070
I have to hit the target every time

1160
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,280
The next step is to race against time

1161
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:57,990
Don't give them time to fight back

10 o'clock direction 16 miles away

1173

10 o'clock direction 15 miles away

1181
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,260
Will call at 12 miles

1182
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,760
Sligo approaches, keeps the same direction, 14 miles away

1183
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,980
The artillery commander will then hit the main gun on the front deck

1184
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,020
Do you shoot again?

1185
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,960
There is no time to confirm the ray, hurry up

1186
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,750
Is the target fore deck main gun

1187
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,710
Detected enemy ship radar waves, we are locked

1191
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,110
Isokaze, shelling is coming

1192
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,390
Stop on both sides

1193
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:45,560
Rewind at full speed, fast, reverse

1194

Stop on both sides, reverse at full speed, fast

1195
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,370
Flash away

1196

Both enemy ships have lost their combat effectiveness

1199
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:18,070
Isokaze unscathed

1200
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,070
Great

1201
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:26,550
Worthy of being the captain of the floating ship

1202
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,530
I'll report to the commander

1203
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,910
The information center calls the bridge, the obstacles have been cleared in the field of vision

captain

1206
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,640
Whether we or the enemy

1207
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,090
Tried their best not to cause casualties

1208
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,230
Everyone has the same idea, right

1209
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,710
If you sink those two warships

1210
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:14,880
From an international humanitarian perspective, we must help the survivors

1211
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:19,080
Especially the deputy captain, aren’t you very tough on this?

1212
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:23,850
For our fleet, the top priority is to reach the sea area of ​​Boriu.

1213
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:26,080
Don't have the time and energy to do that

1214
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,980
That's it, Mr. Xinbo

1215
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:43,110
I really miss it

1216
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:47,410
Among the 54th National Defense Graduates

1217
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:51,860
Only you, Qiujin Ryota, will add "Mr." to the name of your classmate

1218
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,810
I haven't changed since then

1219
01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:00,110
We are capable of war

1220
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:03,140
But never go to war

1221
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,930
I still remember it in my heart and stand here

1222
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:16,060
Some things cannot be guarded without fighting

1223
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,080
The difference between you and me seems to have not changed

1224
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,280
Not only one thing is the same

1225
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,090
Is your family going to have a second child?

1226
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:36,430
what

1227
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:44,840
Let your children embrace the dream of the future and live a peaceful life

1228
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:48,470
Japan must become such a country

1229
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:54,530
To protect Japan, everyone has the same belief

1230
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,150
I didn't expect that you would say this when you are single

1231
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:09,650
I used to think that you were out of gregariousness from the beginning of the national defense era

1232
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:12,140
More suitable for the Air Self-Defense Force

1233
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:18,260
Been here for half a year

1234
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:23,420
I still don’t understand why Mr. Xinbo chose the Maritime Self-Defense Force

1235
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:33,140
Boarding the boat is equivalent to handing over each other's lives

1236
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:35,370
Whether in battle or death

1237
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:41,820
It’s not easy to understand that all alone in the fighter.

1238
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:50,450
Next, the situation will be more severe

1239
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:04,360
An hour ago, the UN Security Council started

1240
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:08,360
We explained what happened to all countries as much as possible

1241
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:11,540
But they have their own plans

1242
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,900
I'm afraid it will take time to draw a conclusion

1243
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,880
If possible, they don’t want to get involved with this, right?

1244
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:20,170
-Then I will leave first.-Yeah

1245
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:31,430
The constitution prohibits participation in war and military preparation

1246
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:37,810
But to ensure independence, every country has the right to self-defense

1247
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:40,810
This is a natural right above the constitution

1248
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:45,950
To resist foreign invasion

1249
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:49,890
Must have a minimum of armed

1250
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:58,570
The right to self-defense has become a reality

1251
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,750
The Self-Defense Forces carry the history after World War II

1252
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,280
Is fighting hard now

1253
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:16,760
We must not make leadership mistakes

1254
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,920
The European branch and the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Apollo have made an appointment

1255
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:40,190
45 minutes later, there is a telephone conversation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Seongsan

1256
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:43,990
Is negotiating with other permanent members through the diplomatic channel

1257
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,360
Ethiopian Presidency

1258
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,610
Non-permanent members Ukraine Uruguay Italy

1259
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:54,200
And G7 chair country Canada

1260
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,450
Tell this to the UN delegation

1261
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:57,450
In today's era

1262
01:24:57,450 --> 01:25:01,610
Everyone knows that wars between nations will inevitably create risks that affect the global economy

1263
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,160
If you make good use of this, the UN’s response may also change.

1264
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:05,850
Yes

1265
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,100
Submarines from various countries have surfaced again

1266
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:28,980
They are still behind us and there is one more ship

1267
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:31,470
Is a Chinese submarine

1268
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:38,440
Are all the major countries of the United Nations gathered?

1269
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:42,400
Hawkeye calls Ibuki

1270
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,240
This is Ibuki

1271
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,550
MiG-35 takes off from an enemy aircraft carrier

1272
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:49,690
A total of ten flew to Ibuki

1273
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:53,080
Altitude 30,000 feet, speed 1.5 Mach

1274
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:54,870
30 minutes to arrive

1275
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:00,340
Captain, if ten planes are not deployed, it is difficult to ensure safety

1276
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:05,700
Listen, the enemy has increased its attack

1277
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:09,220
Albatross Captain

1278
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,420
It's time for us to attack

1279
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,360
Needless to say, what is needed most now is teamwork

1280
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:17,060
Trust and be trusted by wingmen, team members and renovators

1281
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:21,990
Support each other and firmly believe that they are the main force of the Air Self-Defense Force and show pride

1282
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:21,900
Albatross

1283
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:27,590
Then you have to calmly deal with whatever situation you encounter

1284
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:31,170
Let them see the results of our training

1285
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:32,580
understand

1286
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:37,480
Information Center This is the carrier-based aircraft warehouse. The elevator has been repaired.

1287
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,730
Captain, have you caught up?

1288
01:26:40,510 --> 01:26:41,320
Well done

1289
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,880
The 92nd Flight Group is ready to attack

1290
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:57,290
Repeat the 92nd flight group, ready to attack

1291
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:11,210
Commander Yuanshang: This is battle, not training

1292
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,320
If it is entangled by an enemy plane, it is allowed to shoot down

1293
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:18,190
Yes, instructions to the pilot

1294
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,470
The first is to warn that the enemy will not move, I will not move

1295
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:24,110
Plus

1296
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:25,740
Yes

1297
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:30,330
If you are confused...

1298
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:40,400
Fire if you are confused

1299
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:43,810
This is what the captain said

1300
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:47,940
If you are confused, fire

1301
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:03,420
Amulet that bless me not lost

1302

1303
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:10,400

1304
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,370
Five have taken off

1305
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:21,420
excuse me

1306
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,280
This is a sympathy meal prepared by the captain for the two of you

1307
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,590
Please eat while hot

1308

01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,390
Five aircraft of the MiG-35 front team launched missiles

1316
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:24,720
10 rounds in total, 50 miles away

1317
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,200
Attention team, this is Albatross 1

1318
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:30,450
Allow weapons to fire at will

1319
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:33,420
Let's fight each other with the target

1320
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:42,970
Release inducer

1321
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:54,720
The Albatross were not shot

1322
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:58,360
Information Center Calling Albatross 1

1323
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,820
Keep the missile's range to avoid a two-to-one situation

1324
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,450
Understand, attention, team, this is Albatross 1.

1325
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:07,670
Don’t target all 10

1326
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:12,070
Take the rising enemy aircraft formation as the Alpha team and the forward formation as the Beta team

1327
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:13,640
Go around Alpha's left wing

1328
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:15,800
Don't care about beta

1329
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:17,690
Target 5 of Alpha Team

1330
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:19,920
Each decides that the prey is ready to attack

1331
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:23,510
Distance 25 This time it's my turn

1332
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:25,650
Tooth for tooth launch

1333
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:10,550
OK, shoot down two

1334
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,970
10 o'clock direction enemy missile

1335
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,370
Dodge all enemy missiles

1336
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:32,480
(Deception paper: a small piece of metal shot to confuse the enemy's radar tracking and locking)

1337
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:32,480
Now everyone's deception paper and inducement bullets are finished

1338
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:39,350
Confirm to shoot down the fourth Alpha

1339
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:42,480
None of the Albatross planes were shot

1340
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:46,580
Was not shot by such an attack

1341
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:48,410
6 enemy planes left

1342
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:54,150
Returning pilots usually leave a missile for pursuit

1343
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:57,920
In other words, they have 6 missiles left

1344
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:00,950
Air combat requires a lot of fuel

1345
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:05,340
Considering the return distance, maybe another 2 or 3 minutes is the limit.

1346
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:10,000
Then, the albatross team won, right?

1347
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:18,930
Let's talk through this time

1348
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:23,070
Locked

1349
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:29,900
Hawkeye Calls the Albatross

1350
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:31,850
Enemy plane launches missile

1351
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:35,730
6 enemy aircraft launched at the same time to take evasive action

1352
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:38,270
Albatross number 2 calls number 1

1353
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:42,470
6 enemy missiles, all targets are local

1354
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:47,750
6 pieces all

1355
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,500
Albatross 2 Turn right and maneuver to escape towards the sea

1356
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,290
Roger that

1357
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:04,280
Kakinuma, hold on

1358
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,950
Pull up when there is still 6000 from the sea

1359
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:11,830
Kakinuma, hold on

1360
01:33:21,210 --> 01:33:22,020
not good

1361
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:27,280
Kakinuma fast ejection

1362
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:32,010
Reduce speed and leave the cabin

1363
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:38,250
Captain this fighter

1364
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:42,710
15 billion

1365
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:44,200
idiot

1366
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:46,330
Fighter can replace

1367
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:48,240
You can't replace

1368
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:51,590
Kakinuma catapult

1369
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:56,450
Kakinuma

1370
01:33:58,530 --> 01:34:00,020
Kakinuma

1371
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:12,940
I am irreplaceable

1372
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,150
The enemy plane retreated

1373
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,770
Check if 1st Lieutenant Kakinuma survived

1374
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:33,920
At the same time, confirm whether the enemy pilot is alive

1375
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:34,930
Yes

1376
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:41,900
Where's the pilot

1377
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:45,880
Is searching now

1378
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,540
I haven't found his trace yet

1379
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:51,210
The helicopter caught the distress signal

1380
01:34:51,990 --> 01:34:54,920
Confirming whether it has opened the lifeboat

1381
01:34:57,820 --> 01:35:00,770
Catapult at that speed is very dangerous

1382
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:02,930
Believe he is still alive

1383
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,090
captain

1384
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:09,490
Even if you order a fighter plane,

1385
01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:11,230
The enemy aircraft carrier has 60 fighters

1386
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:13,820
We only have 15 which is a quarter of theirs

1387
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:15,740
Even if you shoot down 4 enemy fighters,

1388
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:17,570
It’s also very unfortunate that we lost 1 fighter

1389
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,480
The enemy also judged this way

1390
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:23,650
The battle will be more severe

1391
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:25,610
Be mentally prepared

1392
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:26,610
Yes

1393
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,730
Don’t be proud even if you shoot down 4 enemy aircraft

1394
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:40,380
Does he mean this

1395
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:43,770
No, he wanted to thank you

1396
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:44,480
thank

1397
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:48,170
Just let Lieutenant Kakinuma eject and escape

1398
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:52,600
What he said can’t be less

1399
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:56,060
Means not wanting to lose anyone

1400
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:09,370
Found 1st Captain Kakinuma and confirmed his survivor

1401
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:13,400
Found 1st Captain Kakinuma and confirmed his survivor

1402
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:31,020
Deputy Captain Order

1403
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,800
Each department takes turns dining

1404
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:39,570
Everyone, are you hungry?

1405
01:36:41,350 --> 01:36:43,280
Eat first

1406
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:45,110
Yes

1407
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:50,470
Anti-air and anti-submarine security continues to be tight

1408
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:11,020
Prime Minister good news

1409
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:14,090
The helicopter rescued Lieutenant Kakinuma from the cabin

1410
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:16,760
An enemy pilot was found on the way back

1411
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,870
And rescued it

1412
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,510
Just caught a prisoner

1413
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:27,540
Saved two lives

1414
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:33,160
good news

1415
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,320
No enemy target is found in the field of view

1416
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:44,340
Repeat again, no enemy target is found in the field of vision

1417
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,240
The departments are taking turns dining

1418
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:01,070
Morale is high

1419
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,250
is it

1420
01:38:03,070 --> 01:38:04,840
How is the status of the enemy pilot

1421
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:07,230
No trauma found

1422
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:08,690
But still not regaining consciousness

1423
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,190
Roger that

1424
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:12,190
Send to the infirmary after returning

1425
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,200
I hope we can rescue the East Asian Federation pilot

1426
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:18,920
Be able to communicate to each other smoothly

1427
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:20,150
smoothly

1428
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,380
In order to achieve mutual understanding

1429
01:38:32,590 --> 01:38:34,000
I can go

1430
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,630
Don't move please lie down

1431
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:00,960
Hello hello

1432
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,470
doing what

1433
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:03,760
Quick to subdue him

1434
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,010
stop

1435
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:06,540
Stop, stop

1436
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:07,630
What are you holding

1437
01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:09,110
What are you holding

1438
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,390
It's dangerous to go out

1439
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:35,420
Can not be done

1440
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,500
Kakinuma

1441
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:53,300
You bastard

1442
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:55,610
Look at what you did

1443
01:39:58,860 --> 01:39:59,900
Don't shoot

1444
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:04,170
Captain, this guy killed Lieutenant Kakinuma.

1445
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:06,220
He has no weapons anymore

1446
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:10,560
We rescued him and he came back alive

1447
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:12,840
But

1448
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:42,880
It must be cold in the sea

1449
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:49,200
Tonight is christmas eve

1450
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,680
I don’t know the tradition of your country

1451
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:01,850
In Japan

1452
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:09,290
We will celebrate this holiday but it has nothing to do with faith

1453
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:19,400
We just want to be able to peacefully

1454
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,190
Spend this day

1455
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,010
Take him to the detention room

1456
01:42:06,210 --> 01:42:08,330
Give him another hot drink

1457
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:09,510
Yes

1458
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:13,650
-Come.-It's okay. Let's go

1459
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:55,880
Lieutenant Kakinuma will leave it to you

1460
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,000
Yes

1461
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,180
Return to their posts

1462
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:30,560
Yes

1463
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,010
Don't shoot

1464
01:43:56,780 --> 01:44:02,110
The world is one home
Everyone is good friend

1465
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:08,230
cheer up

1466
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:49,160
I saw a blazing flame on the frigate today

1467
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:53,520
I saw someone falling down covered in blood

1468
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:04,060
Where's the Minister of Foreign Affairs

1469
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,770
Is having a phone conversation with the Chinese ambassador

1470
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:10,880
In 5 hours, we have had telephone conversations with diplomats from eight countries

1471
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:12,960
Still motivated

1472
01:45:14,170 --> 01:45:15,440
Don't look at him like that

1473
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,490
The heart for the country is much stronger than others

1474
01:45:19,150 --> 01:45:22,330
The chairman of the Security Council just now

1475
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:24,690
Called the UN Ambassador Nomura

1476
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:27,470
Calling

1477
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:49,530
Hawkeye calls Ibuki

1478
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,840
The enemy fighter takes off from the aircraft carrier

1479
01:45:52,230 --> 01:45:53,990
Strengthen air vigilance

1480
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:57,590

A total of 24 aircraft with the main force

1482
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:01,380
Now even the anti-ship missiles are coming

1483
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:04,020
I will confirm that the ship is sealed and prepare to deal with the attack of enemy aircraft

1484
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:10,980
The Albatross fighter plane is under preparation

1485
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:14,280
The first to take off is a total of 10 fighters from the Sparrows and the White Doves

1486
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:17,890
The sparrows and the white doves are ready to attack

1487
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:25,780
I’m Bendo. I’m reporting from the aircraft carrier Ibuki.

1488
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:30,500
Are you ok?

1489
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,580
it should be no problem

1490
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:35,270
Ok send to the world

1491
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:39,180
Your English is good

1492

Take off immediately when you're ready

1497
01:47:06,020 --> 01:47:06,860
Roger that

Please let me go

1499
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:17,270
I understand the characteristics of enemy aircraft

1500
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,160
can

1501
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:22,540
But don't think about revenge

1502
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:23,810
Will make you lose your judgment

1503
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:27,760
There are torpedoes at 2 o'clock

1504
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,300
15 miles away, total of 8

1505
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:39,270
The departure of the morning tide is very bad for us

1506
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:43,670
Information center call bridge

1507
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:46,320

(SM2: Standard 2 air defense missile)

1529
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,520
Launch SM2 missiles

1530
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:21,130

This is the greeting from the 4 fighters of the vanguard

1535
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:41,200
After meeting with the main force, they will rush over in one breath

1536
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:43,440
The artillery commander, take good care

1537
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:44,180
Roger that

1538
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,650
Strict air security

1539
01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:50,030
Repeat it again

1540
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:01,030
24 fighters are here

1541
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:06,510
Maximum speed of each ship

Sailing in a zigzag

1543

01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:18,950
I am Yuan Shang

1546
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:20,850
Under missile attack

1547
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:22,700
As a result, fighters from behind the 2nd plane cannot take off

1548
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:26,820
Only 1 fighter

1549
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:35,440
Can you hear it?

1550
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,030
Yes

1551
01:50:37,570 --> 01:50:39,900
One fighter plane alone cannot fight 24 enemy planes

1552
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:43,280
Can it fly close to the sea and approach an enemy aircraft carrier?

1553
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:45,090
Roger that

1554
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:02,680
The enemy formation is less than 75 miles away

1555
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:06,570
Attack target 1st to 24th enemy aircraft formation

1556
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:08,370
Attack at 50 miles

1557
01:51:08,370 --> 01:51:11,980
SM2 missiles 21 to 44 are ready to launch

1558
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,280
What is the current height of the water

1559
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:16,600
50 feet above the sea

1560
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:19,880
Listen, penetrate the splint of the enemy aircraft carrier

1561
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:21,780
Don’t let their subsequent fighters take off

1562
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:23,550
Roger that

1563
01:51:23,550 --> 01:51:24,570
Press water

1564
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:25,590
Yes

1565
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:29,090
Be careful not to spin up

1566
01:51:31,770 --> 01:51:32,670
Roger that

1567
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:42,200
Thank you

1568
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,350
Will the store manager come out?

1569
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:45,980
I went to see

1570
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:47,200
Hurry up

1571
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,300
very sorry

1572
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:50,480
Sorry please wait

1573
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,320
What's up? Really, I've been waiting for a long time

1574
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:14,300
The enemy formation entered within 50 miles of our side

1575
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:16,070
Has entered the range of the anti-ship missile

1576
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,860
Air combat

1577
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,650
Can't let go of an enemy plane

1578
01:52:21,340 --> 01:52:23,980
Target enemy fighter

1579
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:25,740
Start attack

1580
01:52:26,010 --> 01:52:26,880
emission

1581
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:04,230
Our target is the enemy aircraft and missiles that Aiying missed

1582
01:53:04,230 --> 01:53:05,670
Give me all in one pot

1583
01:53:05,670 --> 01:53:06,390
Yes

1584
01:53:06,390 --> 01:53:08,950
Air combat, ready to launch SM2 missiles

1585
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:11,340
Data input is complete, launch preparation is complete

1586
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,350
hit

1587
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:13,690
emission

1588
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:38,130
Captain is a submarine

1589
01:53:38,130 --> 01:53:39,440
And 5 ships

1590
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,510
Bearing 190 and 12 miles away

1591
01:53:42,510 --> 01:53:44,510
Between the enemy carrier and us

1592
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:47,890
Have been lurking there

1593
01:53:55,290 --> 01:53:56,470
Aihawk Isokaze

1594
01:53:56,470 --> 01:53:57,850
Anti-submarine combat preparation

1595
01:53:58,990 --> 01:54:01,480
The submarine launched a torpedo

1596
01:54:02,650 --> 01:54:03,850
10 pieces in total

1597
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:13,960
Anti-submarine warfare begins, ready to launch decoys

1598
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:23,850
The torpedo’s offensive route is scattered

1599
01:54:24,570 --> 01:54:26,450
5 shots towards us

1600
01:54:30,010 --> 01:54:31,200
The remaining 5 rounds

1601
01:54:32,590 --> 01:54:33,760
Towards the enemy fleet

1602
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:35,770
Heading to enemy aircraft carrier

1603
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:36,710
what

1604
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:43,360
Can you hear the pressure?

1605
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:44,320
Yes

1606
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,420
Stop attack

1607
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:46,340
what

1608
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:48,450
Leave the battlefield immediately

1609
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:51,210
Roger that

1610
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:58,720
The torpedo is coming

1611
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:16,470
captain

1612
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:23,510
Blew up?

1613
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:33,170
There is also the sound of torpedo explosions around the enemy fleet

1614
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:35,110
Hit?

1615
01:55:35,610 --> 01:55:38,560
No, I blew myself up close like us

1616
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,960
5 submarines floated

1617
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:46,990
what is the problem

1618
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:04,840
Signal recognition

1619
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,050
Is the UN Force

1620
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:10,070
The entire fleet bears the logo of the United Nations force

1621
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:28,330
Does the United Nations allow the fighting to continue to escalate?

1622
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:37,020
The enemy plane dispersed

1623
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:57,780
Caught up

1624
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:10,610
The enemy carrier fleet changed its course

1625
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:12,520
it is good

1626
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:23,630
Is this also what you expected

1627
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:45,010
Overcoming difficulties

1628
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:50,700
Not just us

1629
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:55,530
I know

1630
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:03,040
Hatsushima’s fishing fleet has all left the island

1631
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:06,060
is it

1632
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:11,580
Five permanent members participate in the UN forces at the same time

1633
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,830
End local disputes

1634
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:15,760
For the first time ever

1635
01:58:16,450 --> 01:58:17,200
indeed

1636
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:20,340
In the future, our job is

1637
01:58:20,990 --> 01:58:23,520
How to make the other person understand their mistakes

1638
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,450
Not true diplomacy

1639
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:30,790
Is to pursue the practical happiness of both countries

1640
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:33,440
And never achieve justice

1641
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:37,820
Never take this step, not drive the opponent into desperation

1642
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:41,830
It's also our diplomatic posture, right?

1643
01:58:42,140 --> 01:58:45,300
Yes, take it seriously

1644
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,520
-understand

1645
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:54,960
But the development of things

1646
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:01,730
Always unexpected

1647
01:59:01,730 --> 01:59:02,520
Don't shoot

1648
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:03,140
captain

1649
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:04,800
This guy killed Lieutenant Kakinuma

1650
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,260
He has no weapons anymore

1651
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:09,480
We rescued him and he came back alive

1652
01:59:10,490 --> 01:59:13,590
But but

1653
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:16,330
Can't shoot

1654
01:59:22,450 --> 01:59:27,140
I saw a blazing flame on the frigate today

1655
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:31,390
I saw someone falling down covered in blood

1656
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,880
My legs trembled and I couldn't move

1657
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,440
This is war

1658
01:59:42,910 --> 01:59:44,630
This must never happen

1659
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:46,970
Never allowed

1660
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:53,460
I naturally have such thoughts in my heart

1661
01:59:57,350 --> 02:00:02,670
But there are also battles to prevent war

1662
02:00:06,470 --> 02:00:08,190
Although very contradictory

1663
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:10,390
But this is also true

1664
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:16,540
Whether battle will develop into war

1665
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:22,810
Is the responsibility of all of us in this world

1666
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:26,560
Even if it will be sad

1667
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:28,510
remorse

1668
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:31,040
Someone will sacrifice

1669
02:00:32,190 --> 02:00:40,380
I have to keep working hard until the day when there is no dispute in the world

1670
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:43,580
The world is gradually becoming a whole...

1671
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:48,090
The above is the report sent by Yuko Honda from the aircraft carrier Ibuki

1672
02:00:48,630 --> 02:00:56,320
I’m Bendo. I’m reporting from the aircraft carrier Ibuki.

1673
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:09,270
Good morning

1674
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:12,430
The crisis of war has dissipated

1675
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:15,060
Full-scale conflict has been avoided

1676
02:01:15,990 --> 02:01:20,330
The team that occupied Hatsushima has also left

1677
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:25,740
Now the 5th escort group centered on the aircraft carrier Ibuki

1678
02:01:25,740 --> 02:01:30,190
Is continuing to maintain the silver guard against air and submarine

1679
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,970
Not silver, strict, strict

1680
02:01:35,490 --> 02:01:39,310
Continue to maintain strict alert against air and submarine

1681
02:01:39,310 --> 02:01:42,960
Going to Hatsushima to rescue the maritime security officer

1682
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:49,740
Pain pain

1683
02:01:53,450 --> 02:01:54,030
what

1684
02:01:55,210 --> 02:01:57,800
Sorry sorry

1685
02:01:58,380 --> 02:01:59,780
I accidentally fell asleep

1686
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:04,520
But I have done it well

1687
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:08,900
I will cheer for 20%

1688
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:10,080
20%, let me go

1689
02:02:12,970 --> 02:02:13,600
Eh

1690
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:20,760
what happened

1691
02:02:21,030 --> 02:02:23,040
Xiaojing Xiaojing

1692
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:24,480
Xiaojing, is this the thief?

1693
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:27,440
Xiaojing, are you hurt?

1694
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:28,570
give me

1695
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:30,960
What water?

1696
02:02:31,970 --> 02:02:33,780
Christmas gift

1697
02:02:35,350 --> 02:02:36,640
Christmas gift

1698
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:39,510
Christmas

1699
02:02:41,710 --> 02:02:42,420
this one

1700
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:47,750
If you don't dislike this, then

1701
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:49,310
Give you

1702
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:53,650
Merry Christmas

1703
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:55,350
what

1704
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:58,990
Merry christmas santa

1705
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:02,560
Merry Christmas

1706
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:07,050
What happened

1707
02:03:08,700 --> 02:03:10,390
Hotan, you scared me to death. What are you doing?

1708
02:03:14,090 --> 02:03:15,290
Go for a drink

1709
02:03:15,670 --> 02:03:17,920
Is there still a shop open after this order?

1710
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:20,640
Don't underestimate Tokyo

1711
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:23,200
Everything here

1712
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:24,180
Also

1713
02:03:24,650 --> 02:03:27,210
But I won't go

1714
02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:28,760
why

1715
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:31,130
My kid should get up

1716
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:35,180
How old is your child

1717
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:36,930
5 years old exactly 5 years old

1718
02:03:43,550 --> 02:03:45,830
To you merry christmas

1719
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:47,490
For 5 year olds

1720
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:53,890
You have been with the company since yesterday, haven't you

1721
02:03:53,890 --> 02:03:56,010
So no matter what I am the boss

1722
02:03:56,010 --> 02:03:56,760
How to say

1723
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:57,760
Mean

1724
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:00,990
But the meaning in this case is its original meaning

1725
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:09,270
No matter what

1726
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,020
Merry Christmas all over Japan

1727
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:29,430
Did not cause a situation where both sides were hurt

1728
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:32,640
The conclusion is that there is a tie

1729
02:04:33,690 --> 02:04:35,600
But as a result of diplomatic negotiations

1730
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:37,690
This is also the most ideal

1731
02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:40,160
If 100 vs. 0 wins

1732
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:43,960
The hatred of the loser will never disappear

1733
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:49,760
It’s the result of a big country pushing a small country to a dead end

1734
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:53,040
That made the world today

1735
02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:04,090
The side dishes of the bento are always egg rolls and octopus sausage

1736
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:08,930
After complaining to my mother, I was beaten by my father for the first time

1737
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:16,240
The wife asked the younger son several times what to wear for the entrance ceremony

1738
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:21,580
For grandson’s birthday, grandparents started busy early in the morning

1739
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:27,570
I struggled with what Christmas gifts to buy for my lover for 10 days

1740
02:05:28,750 --> 02:05:32,000
Buying a house is a lifetime thing

1741
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:40,640
Then one day, I sent my parents away with gratitude

1742
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:45,400
I say Shidu

1743
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,220
We want to protect

1744
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:51,260
Just these ordinary happiness

1745
02:05:53,260 --> 02:05:56,300
Humble and tiny happiness

1746
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:00,940
For this we will become politicians

1747
02:06:02,830 --> 02:06:03,810
Yes

1748
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:11,790
OK, let's hold a press conference

1749
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:14,680
it is good

1750
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,020
Shidu

1751
02:06:20,290 --> 02:06:23,870
Can i work for another 3 years

1752
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:51,200
In-ship patrol 2nd equipped 2nd straight sentry

1753
02:06:49,690 --> 02:06:50,460
Deputy captain

1754
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:52,070
Yes

1755
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:57,630
Order the cooking class, prepare hot rice balls and miso soup

1756
02:06:58,240 --> 02:06:58,800
it is good

1757
02:07:00,910 --> 02:07:03,720
Waiting for our brothers at Hatsushima

1758
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:05,580
Should be hungry

1759
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:08,310
Give them food first

1760
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:17,970
I thought pilots wouldn’t care if others were hungry

1761
02:07:19,390 --> 02:07:20,670
You don't know enough

1762
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:23,960
I'll get them to prepare

1763
02:07:25,290 --> 02:07:28,340
Vice Captain, my meal

1764
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:30,090
Send it to the captain's room as usual

1765
02:07:30,090 --> 02:07:30,660
Do not

1766
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:34,400
I want to eat with everyone in the cafeteria

1767
02:07:38,130 --> 02:07:39,900
Do you want to talk about the anecdote of your own fighter?

1768
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:46,960
I want to hear everyone tell the story of this ship and the sea

1769
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:50,980
understand

1770
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,910
Summarize and organize the sentry equipment on the ship

1771
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:03,200
It's the second direct sailing duty, please be prepared

1772
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:33,680
Hot

1773
02:08:34,370 --> 02:08:35,920
This is hot

1774
02:09:07,070 --> 02:09:11,660
Masato Kakinuma
